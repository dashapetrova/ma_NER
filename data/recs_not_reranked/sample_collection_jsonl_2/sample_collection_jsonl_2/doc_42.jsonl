Another name for it is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). CFS can often make you unable to do your usual activities. Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed.What causes chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?The cause of CFS is unknown. There may be more than one thing that causes it. It is possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness.Who is at risk for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?Anyone can get CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women have it more often that adult men. Whites are more likely than other races to get a diagnosis of CFS, but many people with CFS have not been diagnosed with it.What are the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?CFS symptoms can include:Severe fatigue that is not improved by restSleep problemsPost-exertional malaise (PEM), where your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activityProblems with thinking and concentratingPainDizzinessCFS can be unpredictable. Your symptoms may come and go. They may change over time - sometimes they might get better, and other times they may get worse.How is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) diagnosed?CFS can be difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test for CFS, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of CFS. He or she will do a thorough medical exam, including:Asking about your medical history and your family's medical historyAsking about your current illness, including your symptoms. Your doctor will want to know how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life.A thorough physical and mental status examBlood, urine, or other testsWhat are the treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?There is no cure or approved treatment for CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms. You, your family, and your health care provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not \"push and crash.\" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again.Since the process of developing a treatment plan and attending to self-care can be hard if you have CFS, it is important to have support from family members and friends.Don't try any new treatments without talking to your health care provider. Some treatments that are promoted as cures for CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}

In any case, it can get better with proper treatment.What are the types of urinary incontinence (UI)?There are several different types of UI. Each type has different symptoms and causes:Stress incontinence happens when stress or pressure on your bladder causes you to leak urine.  This could be due to coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, or physical activity. Causes include weak pelvic floor muscles and the bladder being out of its normal position.Urge, or urgency, incontinence happens when you have a strong urge (need) to urinate, and some urine leaks out before you can make it to the toilet. It is often related to an overactive bladder. Urge incontinence is most common in older people. It can sometimes be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It can also happen in some neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries.Overflow incontinence happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. This causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. Your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. This form of UI is most common in men. Some of the causes include tumors, kidney stones, diabetes, and certain medicines.Functional incontinence happens when a physical or mental disability, trouble speaking, or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. For example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with Alzheimer's disease may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet.Mixed incontinence means that you have more than one type of incontinence. It's usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence.Transient incontinence is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine.

This means taking the medicines in a different way than the health care provider prescribed. This includesTaking a medicine that was prescribed for someone elseTaking a larger dose than you are supposed toUsing the medicine in a different way than you are supposed to. For example, instead of swallowing your tablets, you might crush and then snort or inject them.Using the medicine for another purpose, such as getting highMisusing over-the-counter medicines, including using them for another purpose and using them in a different way than you are supposed toDrug use is dangerous. It can harm your brain and body, sometimes permanently. It can hurt the people around you, including friends, families, kids, and unborn babies. Drug use can also lead to addiction.What is drug addiction?Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It causes a person to take drugs repeatedly, despite the harm they cause. Repeated drug use can change the brain and lead to addiction.The brain changes from addiction can be lasting, so drug addiction is considered a \"relapsing\" disease. This means that people in recovery are at risk for taking drugs again, even after years of not taking them.Does everyone who takes drugs become addicted?Not everyone who uses drugs becomes addicted. Everyone's bodies and brains are different, so their reactions to drugs can also be different. Some people may become addicted quickly, or it may happen over time. Other people never become addicted. Whether or not someone becomes addicted depends on many factors. They include genetic, environmental, and developmental factors.Who is at risk for drug addiction?Various risk factors can make you more likely to become addicted to drugs, including:Your biology. People can react to drugs differently. Some people like the feeling the first time they try a drug and want more. Others hate how it feels and never try it again.Mental health problems. People who have untreated mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to become addicted. This can happen because drug use and mental health problems affect the same parts of the brain. Also, people with these problems may use drugs to try to feel better.Trouble at home. If your home is an unhappy place or was when you were growing up, you might be more likely to have a drug problem.Trouble in school, at work, or with making friends. You might use drugs to get your mind off these problems.Hanging around other people who use drugs. They might encourage you to try drugs.Starting drug use when you're young. When kids use drugs, it affects how their bodies and brains finish growing. This increases your chances of becoming addicted when you're an adult.What are the signs that someone has a drug problem?Signs that someone has a drug problem include:Changing friends a lotSpending a lot of time aloneLosing interest in favorite thingsNot taking care of themselves - for example, not taking showers, changing clothes, or brushing their teethBeing really tired and sadEating more or eating less than usualBeing very energetic, talking fast, or saying things that don't make senseBeing in a bad moodQuickly changing between feeling bad and feeling goodSleeping at strange hoursMissing important appointmentsHaving problems at work or at schoolHaving problems in personal or family relationshipsWhat are the treatments for drug addiction?Treatments for drug addiction include counseling, medicines, or both. Research shows that combining medicines with counseling gives most people the best chance of success.The counseling may be individual, family, and/or group therapy. It can help you:Understand why you got addictedSee how drugs changed your behaviorLearn how to deal with your problems so you won't go back to using drugsLearn to avoid places, people, and situations where you might be tempted to use drugsMedicines can help with the symptoms of withdrawal. For addiction to certain drugs, there are also medicines that can help you re-establish normal brain function and decrease your cravings.If you have a mental disorder along with an addiction, it is known as a dual diagnosis. It is important to treat both problems. This will increase your chance of success.If you have a severe addiction, you may need hospital-based or residential treatment. Residential treatment programs combine housing and treatment services.Can drug use and addiction be prevented?Drug use and addiction are preventable.

Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. Normally, when one of your blood vessels is injured, you start to bleed. Your platelets will clot (clump together) to plug the hole in the blood vessel and stop the bleeding. You can have different problems with your platelets:If your blood has a low number of platelets, it is called thrombocytopenia. This can put you at risk for mild to serious bleeding. The bleeding could be external or internal. There can be various causes. If the problem is mild, you may not need treatment. For more serious cases, you may need medicines or blood or platelet transfusions.If your blood has too many platelets, you may have a higher risk of blood clots.When the cause is unknown, this is called thrombocythemia. It is rare. You may not need treatment if there are no signs or symptoms. In other cases, people who have it may need treatment with medicines or procedures.If another disease or condition is causing the high platelet count, it is thrombocytosis. The treatment and outlook for thrombocytosis depends on what is causing it.Another possible problem is that your platelets do not work as they should.

Energy drinks may also contain sugars, vitamins, herbs, and supplements.Companies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There's limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine.

{"id": "doc45", "contents": "Diabetic Eye Problems  What is diabetes?Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.What eye problems can diabetes cause?Over time, high blood sugar may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetes eye problems include:Diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment, where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye.Diabetic macular edema (DME), which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (a part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy.Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye.Cataract, which happen when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes.Who is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems?Anyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. But your risk of developing it is higher if you:Have had diabetes for a long timeDon't have good control over your high blood sugar or high blood pressureAre pregnantHave high blood cholesterolSmoke tobaccoWhat are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems?In the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilated eye exams are so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy.You should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could mean an emergency. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms:Many new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters)Flashes of lightA dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtainVision lossEye pain or rednessTalk with your doctor if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go:Spots or dark wavy strings floating in your visionBlurry or wavy visionVision that changes a lotTrouble seeing colorsHow are diabetic eye problems diagnosed?Eye doctors do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems.

If your urinary system is healthy, your bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (2 cups) of urine comfortably for 2 to 5 hours.You may have problems with urination if you have:Kidney failureUrinary tract infectionsAn enlarged prostateBladder control problems like  incontinence, overactive bladder, or interstitial cystitisA blockage that prevents you from emptying your bladder Some conditions may also cause you to have blood or protein in your urine. If you have a urinary problem, see your health care provider. Urinalysis and other urine tests can help to diagnose the problem.

{"id": "doc49", "contents": "Diabetes Type 2  What is type 2 diabetes?Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well. The glucose then stays in your blood and not enough goes into your cells.Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.What causes type 2 diabetes?Type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors:Being overweight or having obesityNot being physically activeGenetics and family historyType 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes?You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:Are over age 45. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get type 2 diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older people.Have prediabetes, which means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetesHad diabetes in pregnancy or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.Have a family history of diabetesAre overweight or have obesityAre Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, or Pacific IslanderAre not physically activeHave other conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or depressionHave low HDL (good) cholesterol and high triglyceridesHave acanthosis nigricans - dark, thick, and velvety skin around your neck or armpitsWhat are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes?Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at all. If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include:Increased thirst and urinationIncreased hungerFeeling tiredBlurred visionNumbness or tingling in the feet or handsSores that do not healUnexplained weight lossHow is type 2 diabetes diagnosed?Your health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include:A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 monthsFasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test.Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.What are the treatments for type 2 diabetes?Treatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine.:A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any.Medicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their diabetes.You will need to check your blood sugar regularly. Your health care provider will tell you how often you need to do it.It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels close to the targets your provider sets for you. Make sure to get your screening tests regularly.Can type 2 diabetes be prevented?You can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active.

Most of the things that you need to do involve having a healthier lifestyle. So if you make these changes, you will get other health benefits as well. You may lower your risk of other diseases, and you will probably feel better and have more energy. The changes are:Losing weight and keeping it off.Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 10% of your current weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose between 10 to 20 pounds. And once you lose the weight, it is important that you don't gain it back.Following a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day, so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that, your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group, including plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It's also a good idea to limit red meat, and avoid processed meats.Get regular exercise. Exercise has many health benefits, including helping you to lose weight and lower your blood sugar levels. These both lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week. If you have not been active, talk with your health care professional to figure out which types of exercise are best for you. You can start slowly and work up to your goal.Don't smoke. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. If you already smoke, try to quit.Talk to your health care provider to see whether there is anything else you can do to delay or to prevent type 2 diabetes. If you are at high risk, your provider may suggest that you take one of a few types of diabetes medicines.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"}
{"id": "doc52", "contents": "Mosquito Bites  Mosquitoes are insects that live all over the world. There are thousands of different species of mosquitoes; about 200 of those live in the United States.Female mosquitoes bite animals and humans and drink a very small amount of their blood. They need protein and iron from blood to produce eggs. After drinking blood, they find some standing water and lay their eggs in it. The eggs hatch into larvae, then pupae, and then they become adult mosquitos. The males live for about a week to ten days, and the females can live up to several weeks. Some female mosquitoes can hibernate in the winter, and they can live for months.What health problems can mosquito bites cause?Most mosquito bites are harmless, but there are times when they can be dangerous. The ways that mosquito bites can affect humans include:Causing itchy bumps, as an immune system response to the mosquito's saliva. This is the most common reaction. The bumps usually go away after a day or two.Causing allergic reactions, including blisters, large hives, and in rare cases, anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that affects the whole body. It is a medical emergency.Spreading diseases to humans. Some of these diseases can be serious. Many of them do not have any treatments, and only a few have vaccines to prevent them. These diseases are more of a problem in Africa and other tropical areas of the world, but more of them are spreading to the United States. One factor is climate change, which makes the conditions in some parts of the United States more favorable to certain types of mosquitoes. Other reasons include increased trade with, and travel to, tropical and subtropical areas.Which diseases can mosquitoes spread?Common diseases spread by mosquitoes include:Chikungunya, a viral infection that causes symptoms such as fever and severe joint pain. The symptoms usually last about a week, but for some, the joint pain may last for months. Most cases of chikungunya in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries. There have been a few cases where it has spread in the United States.Dengue, a viral infection that causes a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. Most people get better within a few weeks. In some cases, it can become very severe, even life-threatening. Dengue is rare in the United States.Malaria, a parasitic disease that causes serious symptoms such as high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness. It can be life-threatening, but there are drugs to treat it. Malaria is a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Almost all cases of malaria in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries.West Nile Virus (WNV), a viral infection that often has no symptoms. In those that do have symptoms, they are usually mild, and include fever, headache, and nausea. In rare cases, the virus can enter the brain, and it can be life-threatening. WNV has spread across the continental United States.Zika Virus, a viral infection that often does not cause symptoms. One in five infected people do get symptoms, which are usually mild. They include a fever, rash, joint pain, and pink eye. Besides being spread by mosquitoes, Zika can spread from mother to baby during pregnancy and cause serious birth defects. It can also spread from one partner to another during sex. There have been a few outbreaks of Zika in the southern United States.Can mosquito bites be prevented?Use an insect repellent when you go outdoors. Choose an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. It is important to follow the instructions on the label.Cover up. Wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin fabric, so spray thin clothes with an EPA-registered repellent like permethrin. Don't apply permethrin directly to skin.Mosquito-proof your home. Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. Use air conditioning if you have it.Get rid of mosquito breeding sites. Regularly empty standing water from your house and yard. The water could be in flowerpots, gutters, buckets, pool covers, pet water dishes, discarded tires, or birdbaths.If you plan to travel, get information about the areas you will be going to. Find out whether there is a risk of diseases from mosquitoes, and if so, whether there is a vaccine or medicine to prevent those diseases. See a health care provider familiar with travel medicine, ideally 4 to 6 weeks before your trip."}

They may start getting irregular menstrual periods as they transition to menopause. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility start before the age of 40. Sometimes it can start as early as the teenage years.POI is different from premature menopause. With premature menopause, your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. With POI, some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant.  In most cases of POI, the cause is unknown.What causes primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?In about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is unknown.Research shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles. Follicles are small sacs in your ovaries. Your eggs grow and mature inside them. One type of follicle problem is that you run out of working follicles earlier than normal. Another is that the follicles are not working properly. In most cases, the cause of the follicle problem is unknown. But sometimes the cause may be:Genetic disorders such as Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndromeA low number of folliclesAutoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis and Addison diseaseChemotherapy or radiation therapyMetabolic disordersToxins, such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, and pesticidesWho is at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?Certain factors can raise a woman's risk of POI:Family history. Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have it.Genes. Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. For example, women Fragile X syndrome or Turner syndrome are at higher risk.Certain diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and viral infectionsCancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapyAge. Younger women can get POI, but it becomes more common between the ages of 35-40.What are the symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?The first sign of POI is usually irregular or missed periods. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause:Hot flashesNight sweatsIrritabilityPoor concentrationDecreased sex drivePain during sexVaginal drynessFor many women with POI, trouble getting pregnant or infertility is the reason they go to their health care provider.What other problems can primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) cause?Since POI causes you to have lower levels of certain hormones, you are at greater risk for other health conditions, including:Anxiety and depression. Hormonal changes caused by POI can contribute to anxiety or lead to depression.Dry eye syndrome and eye surface disease. Some women with POI have one of these eye conditions. Both can cause discomfort and may lead to blurred vision. If not treated, these conditions can cause permanent eye damage.Heart disease. Lower levels of estrogen can affect the muscles lining the arteries and can increase the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. These factors increase your risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).Infertility.Low thyroid function. This problem also is called hypothyroidism. The thyroid is a gland that makes hormones that control your body's metabolism and energy level. Low levels thyroid hormones can affect your metabolism and can cause very low energy, mental sluggishness, and other symptoms.Osteoporosis. The hormone estrogen helps keep bones strong. Without enough estrogen, women with POI often develop osteoporosis. It is a bone disease that causes weak, brittle bones that are more likely to break.How is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnosed?To diagnose POI, your health care provider may do:A medical history, including asking whether you have relatives with POIA pregnancy test, to make sure that you are not pregnantA physical exam, to look for signs of other disorders which could be causing your symptomsBlood tests, to check for certain hormone levels. You may also have a blood test to do a chromosome analysis. A chromosome is the part of a cell that contains genetic information.A pelvic ultrasound, to see whether or not the ovaries are enlarged or have multiple folliclesHow is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) treated?Currently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries.  But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI. There are also ways to lower your health risks and treat the conditions that POI can cause:Hormone replacement therapy (HRT).HRT is the most common treatment. It gives your body the estrogen and other hormones that your ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual health and decreases the risks for heart disease and osteoporosis. You usually take it until about age 50; that's about the age when menopause usually begins.Calcium and vitamin D supplements. Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, you should take calcium and vitamin D every day.In vitro fertilization (IVF). If you have POI and you wish to become pregnant, you may consider trying IVF.Regular physical activity and a healthy body weight.Getting regular exercise and controlling your weight can lower your risk for osteoporosis and heart disease.Treatments for associated conditions. If you have a condition that is related to POI, it is important to treat that as well. Treatments may involve medicines and hormones.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"}

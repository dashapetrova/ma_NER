{"id": "doc1", "contents": "GERD  Your esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) happens when a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back, or reflux, into the esophagus and irritate it. You may feel a burning in the chest or throat called heartburn.  Sometimes, you can taste stomach fluid in the back of the mouth.  If you have these symptoms more than twice a week, you may have GERD. You can also have GERD without having heartburn. Your symptoms could include a dry cough, asthma symptoms, or trouble swallowing.Anyone, including infants and children, can have GERD.  If not treated, it can lead to more serious health problems. In some cases, you might need medicines or surgery.  However, many people can improve their symptoms by:Avoiding alcohol and spicy, fatty or acidic foods that trigger heartburnEating smaller mealsNot eating close to bedtime Losing weight if needed Wearing loose-fitting clothesNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"}
{"id": "doc2", "contents": "Reflux in Infants  What are reflux (GER) and GERD?The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. If your baby has reflux, his or her stomach contents come back up into the esophagus. Another name for reflux is gastroesophageal reflux (GER).GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. Babies may have GERD if their symptoms prevent them from feeding or if the reflux lasts more than 12 to 14 months.What causes reflux and GERD in infants?There is a muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) that acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your baby swallows, this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed, so the stomach contents don't flow back into the esophagus.In babies who have reflux, the lower esophageal sphincter muscle is not fully developed and lets the stomach contents back up the esophagus. This causes your baby to spit up (regurgitate). Once his or her sphincter muscle fully develops, your baby should no longer spit up.In babies who have GERD, the sphincter muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn't. How common are reflux and GERD in infants?Reflux is very common in babies. About half all babies spit up many times a day in the first 3 months of their lives. They usually stop spitting up between the ages of 12 and 14 months.GERD is also common in younger infants. Many 4-month-olds have it. But by their first birthday, only 10% of babies still have GERD. What are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in infants?In babies, the main symptom of reflux and GERD is spitting up. GERD may also cause symptoms such as:Arching of the back, often during or right after eatingColic - crying that lasts for more than 3 hours a day with no medical causeCoughingGagging or trouble swallowingIrritability, especially after eatingPoor eating or refusing to eatPoor weight gain, or weight lossWheezing or trouble breathingForceful or frequent vomitingNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesHow do doctors diagnose reflux and GERD in infants?In most cases, a doctor diagnoses reflux by reviewing your baby's symptoms and medical history. If the symptoms do not get better with feeding changes and anti-reflux medicines, your baby may need testing.Several tests can help a doctor diagnose GERD. Sometimes doctors order more than one test to get a diagnosis. Common tests include:Upper GI series, which looks at the shape of your baby's upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract. Your baby will drink or eat a contrast liquid called barium. The barium is mixed in with a bottle or other food. The health care professional will take several x-rays of your baby to track the barium as it goes through the esophagus and stomach.Esophageal pH and impedance monitoring, which measures the amount of acid or liquid in your baby's esophagus. A doctor or nurse places a thin flexible tube through your baby's nose into the stomach. The end of the tube in the esophagus measures when and how much acid comes up into the esophagus. The other end of the tube attaches to a monitor that records the measurements. Your baby will wear this for 24 hours, most likely in the hospital.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy, which uses an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. The doctor runs the endoscope down your baby's esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope, the doctor may also take tissue samples (biopsy).What feeding changes can help treat my infant's reflux or GERD?Feeding changes may help your baby's reflux and GERD:Add rice cereal to your baby's bottle of formula or breastmilk. Check with the doctor about how much to add. If the mixture is too thick, you can change the nipple size or cut a little \"x\" in the nipple to make the opening larger.Burp your baby after every 1 to 2 ounces of formula. If you breastfeed, burp your baby after nursing from each breast.Avoid overfeeding; give your baby the amount of formula or breast milk recommended.Hold your baby upright for 30 minutes after feedings.If you use formula and your doctor thinks that your baby may be sensitive to milk protein, your doctor may suggest switching to a different type of formula. Do not change formulas without talking to the doctor.What treatments might the doctor give for my infant's GERD?If feeding changes do not help enough, the doctor may recommend medicines to treat GERD. The medicines work by lowering the amount of acid in your baby's stomach. The doctor will only suggest medicine if your baby still has regular GERD symptoms and:You already tried some feeding changesYour baby has problems sleeping or feedingYour baby does not grow properlyThe doctor will often prescribe a medicine on a trial basis and will explain any possible complications. You shouldn't give your baby any medicines unless the doctor tells you to.Medicines for GERD in babies include:H2 blockers, which decrease acid productionProton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which lower the amount of acid the stomach makesIf these don't help and your baby still has severe symptoms, then surgery might be an option. Pediatric gastroenterologists only use surgery to treat GERD in babies in rare cases. They may suggest surgery when babies have severe breathing problems or have a physical problem that causes GERD symptoms."}

With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.What health problems can diabetes cause?Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause complications, including:Eye disease, due to changes in fluid levels, swelling in the tissues, and damage to the blood vessels in the eyesFoot problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow to your feetGum disease and other dental problems, because a high amount of blood sugar in your saliva helps harmful bacteria grow in your mouth. The bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause gum disease and bad breath. Other types cause tooth decay and cavities.Heart disease and stroke, caused by damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vesselsKidney disease, due to damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys.

Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well. The glucose then stays in your blood and not enough goes into your cells.Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.What causes type 2 diabetes?Type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors:Being overweight or having obesityNot being physically activeGenetics and family historyType 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes?You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:Are over age 45. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get type 2 diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older people.Have prediabetes, which means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetesHad diabetes in pregnancy or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.Have a family history of diabetesAre overweight or have obesityAre Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, or Pacific IslanderAre not physically activeHave other conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or depressionHave low HDL (good) cholesterol and high triglyceridesHave acanthosis nigricans - dark, thick, and velvety skin around your neck or armpitsWhat are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes?Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at all.

The symptoms can include:Increased thirst and urinationIncreased hungerFeeling tiredBlurred visionNumbness or tingling in the feet or handsSores that do not healUnexplained weight lossHow is type 2 diabetes diagnosed?Your health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include:A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 monthsFasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test.Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.What are the treatments for type 2 diabetes?Treatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine.:A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any.Medicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their diabetes.You will need to check your blood sugar regularly.

You can have just one risk factor, but people often have several of them together. When you have at least three of them, it is called metabolic syndrome. These risk factors include:A large waistline, also called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Too much fat around the stomach is a greater risk factor for heart disease than too much fat in other parts of the body.Having a high triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.Having a low HDL cholesterol level.

Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into your cells to give them energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood sugar levels.Age - your risk goes up as get olderGenetics - ethnicity and family historyPeople who have metabolic syndrome often also have excessive blood clotting and inflammation throughout the body. Researchers don't know whether these conditions cause metabolic syndrome or worsen it.Who is at risk for metabolic syndrome?The most important risk factors for metabolic syndrome are:Abdominal obesity (a large waistline)An inactive lifestyleInsulin resistanceThere are certain groups of people who have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome:Some racial and ethnic groups. Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome, followed by whites and blacks.People who have diabetesPeople who have a sibling or parent who has diabetesWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)People who take medicines that cause weight gain or changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar levelsWhat are the symptoms of metabolic syndrome?Most of the metabolic risk factors have no obvious signs or symptoms, except for a large waistline.How is metabolic syndrome diagnosed?Your health care provider will diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests.

Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy.  With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin.  With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes.  This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.  Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems.    It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.Blood tests can show if you have diabetes.

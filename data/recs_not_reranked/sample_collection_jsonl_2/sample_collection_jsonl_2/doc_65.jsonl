{"id": "doc2", "contents": "Diabetic Heart Disease  What is diabetes?Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.What is diabetic heart disease?Diabetic heart disease is a term for heart disease in people who have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you are much more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than people who don't have diabetes. And you may start having these problems at a younger age.Over time, the effects of high blood sugar from diabetes can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves in your heart. This damage increases your chance of developing heart diseases, including:Coronary artery disease (CAD). It happens slowly as a sticky material called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood.Heart failure. With this condition, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of your body.Cardiomyopathy. This is a group of diseases in which the heart muscle may become thick or stiff.Who is more likely to develop diabetic heart disease?Diabetes puts you at serious risk for heart disease. It also makes you more likely to develop other conditions that raise your risk even more, including:High blood pressureHigh blood levels of LDL \"bad\" cholesterolHigh triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) with low blood levels of HDL \"good\" cholesterolYour risk for heart disease is also higher if youAre maleSmokeHave obesityHave too much belly fat around your waist, even though you're at a healthy weight:"}

More than half of all Americans will be diagnosed with a mental disorder at some time in their life.How are mental disorders diagnosed?The steps to getting a diagnosis include:A medical historyA physical exam and possibly lab tests, if your provider thinks that other medical conditions could be causing your symptomsA psychological evaluation. You will answer questions about your thinking, feelings, and behaviors.What are the treatments for mental disorders?Treatment depends on which mental disorder you have and how serious it is. You and your provider will work on a treatment plan just for you. It usually involves some type of therapy. You may also take medicines. Some people also need social support and education on managing their condition.In some cases, you may need more intensive treatment. You may need to go to a psychiatric hospital.  This could be because your mental illness is severe. Or it could be because you are at risk of hurting yourself or someone else. In the hospital, you will get counseling, group discussions, and activities with mental health professionals and other patients."}

You may have a sunburn-like rash somewhere on your body. TSS can lead to organ failure.How are staph infections diagnosed?Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Often, providers can tell if you have a staph skin infection by looking at it. To check for other types of staph infections, providers may do a culture, with a skin scraping, tissue sample, stool sample, or throat or nasal swabs. There may be other tests, such as imaging tests, depending on the type of infection.What are the treatments for staph infections?Treatment for staph infections is antibiotics. Depending on the type of infection, you may get a cream, ointment, medicines (to swallow), or intravenous (IV). If you have an infected wound, your provider might drain it.

Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed.What causes chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?The cause of CFS is unknown. There may be more than one thing that causes it. It is possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness.Who is at risk for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?Anyone can get CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women have it more often that adult men. Whites are more likely than other races to get a diagnosis of CFS, but many people with CFS have not been diagnosed with it.What are the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?CFS symptoms can include:Severe fatigue that is not improved by restSleep problemsPost-exertional malaise (PEM), where your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activityProblems with thinking and concentratingPainDizzinessCFS can be unpredictable. Your symptoms may come and go. They may change over time - sometimes they might get better, and other times they may get worse.How is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) diagnosed?CFS can be difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test for CFS, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of CFS. He or she will do a thorough medical exam, including:Asking about your medical history and your family's medical historyAsking about your current illness, including your symptoms. Your doctor will want to know how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life.A thorough physical and mental status examBlood, urine, or other testsWhat are the treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?There is no cure or approved treatment for CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms. You, your family, and your health care provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not \"push and crash.\" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again.Since the process of developing a treatment plan and attending to self-care can be hard if you have CFS, it is important to have support from family members and friends.Don't try any new treatments without talking to your health care provider. Some treatments that are promoted as cures for CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}

{"id": "doc10", "contents": "Diabetes Type 2  What is type 2 diabetes?Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well. The glucose then stays in your blood and not enough goes into your cells.Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.What causes type 2 diabetes?Type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors:Being overweight or having obesityNot being physically activeGenetics and family historyType 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes?You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:Are over age 45.

The symptoms can include:Increased thirst and urinationIncreased hungerFeeling tiredBlurred visionNumbness or tingling in the feet or handsSores that do not healUnexplained weight lossHow is type 2 diabetes diagnosed?Your health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include:A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 monthsFasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test.Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.What are the treatments for type 2 diabetes?Treatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine.:A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any.Medicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines.

{"id": "doc13", "contents": "Angioplasty  What is angioplasty?Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol, calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood.Angioplasty widens the blocked part of the artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).What conditions does angioplasty treat?Doctors use angioplasty to:Reduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary arteries. This type of pain is called angina. There are different types of angina. Angioplasty treats certain types.Limit damage to the heart during or right after a heart attack. In this case, angioplasty is an emergency treatment.Angioplasty does not cure coronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages, you'll need to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise.What happens during angioplasty?Most people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm.Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will:Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel.Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide.Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays.Replace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end.Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall. This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow.Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood clots from forming.What happens after an angioplasty?If you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots. Most people can return to their usual activities after a week.If you had an emergency angioplasty for a heart attack, you'll need to stay in the hospital for about a few more days.Are there any risks from angioplasty?Angioplasty is very safe. You may get a bruise, feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted. More serious problems don't happen very often, but they are possible. They can include serious bleeding, blood clots, and narrowing of the artery again.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute "}

In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines.How do blood pressure medicines work?Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as muchCalcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax.Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions.Often, two or more medicines work better than one. While taking the medicines, it is still important to keep up with your healthy lifestyle changes.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}
{"id": "doc16", "contents": "HDL: The \"Good\" Cholesterol  What is cholesterol?Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease.What are HDL and LDL?HDL and LDL are two types of lipoproteins.They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein.  The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. HDL and LDL have different purposes:HDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body.LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.How do I know what my HDL level is?A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including HDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are:For people who are age 19 or younger::The first test should be between ages 9 to 11Children should have the test again every 5 yearsSome children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or strokeFor people who are age 20 or older::Younger adults should have the test every 5 yearsMen ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 yearsWhat should my HDL level be? With HDL cholesterol, higher numbers are better, because a high HDL level can lower your risk for coronary artery disease and stroke. How high your HDL should be depends on your age and sex:GroupHealthy HDL LevelAge 19 or youngerMore than 45mg/dlMen age 20 or olderMore than 40mg/dlWomen age 20 or olderMore than 50mg/dlHow can I raise my HDL level?If your HDL level is too low, lifestyle changes may help. These changes may also help prevent other diseases, and make you feel better overall:Eat a healthy diet. To raise your HDL level, you need to eat good fats instead of bad fats. This means limiting saturated fats, which include full-fat milk and cheese, high-fat meats like sausage and bacon, and foods made with butter, lard, and shortening. You should also avoid trans fats, which may be in some margarines, fried foods, and processed foods like baked goods. Instead, eat unsaturated fats, which are found in avocado, vegetable oils like olive oil, and nuts. Limit carbohydrates, especially sugar. Also try to eat more foods naturally high in fiber, such as oatmeal and beans.Stay at a healthy weight. You can boost your HDL level by losing weight, especially if you have lots of fat around your waist.Exercise. Getting regular exercise can raise your HDL level, as well as lower your LDL. You should try to do 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise on most, if not all, days.Avoid cigarettes.Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can lower your HDL level. If you are a smoker, ask your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit. You should also try to avoid secondhand smoke.Limit alcohol. Moderate alcohol may lower your HDL level, although more studies are needed to confirm that. What we do know is that too much alcohol can make you gain weight, and that lowers your HDL level.Some cholesterol medicines, including certain statins, can raise your HDL level, in addition to lowering your LDL level. Health care providers don't usually prescribe medicines only to raise HDL. But if you have a low HDL and high LDL level, you might need medicine.What else can affect my HDL level?Taking certain medicines can lower HDL levels in some people. They include:Beta blockers, a type of blood pressure medicineAnabolic steroids, including testosterone, a male hormoneProgestins, which are female hormones that are in some birth control pills and hormone replacement therapyBenzodiazepines, sedatives that are often used for anxiety and insomniaIf you are taking one of these and you have a very low HDL level, ask your provider if you should continue to take them.Diabetes can also lower your HDL level, so that gives you another reason to manage your diabetes."}

It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. If not treated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with your heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle, and fertility.

{"id": "doc18", "contents": "Chronic Kidney Disease  You have two kidneys, each about the size of your fist.  Their main job is to filter your blood. They remove wastes and extra water, which become urine. They also keep the body's chemicals balanced, help control blood pressure, and make hormones.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means that your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. It can also cause other problems that can harm your health. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of CKD.The kidney damage occurs slowly over many years. Many people don't have any symptoms until their kidney disease is very advanced. Blood and urine tests are the only way to know if you have kidney disease.Treatments cannot cure kidney disease, but they may slow kidney disease. They include medicines to lower blood pressure, control blood sugar, and lower cholesterol. CKD may still get worse over time. Sometimes it can lead to kidney failure. If your kidneys fail, you will need  dialysis or a kidney transplantation.You can take steps to keep your kidneys healthier longer:Choose foods with less  salt (sodium)Control your blood pressure; your health care provider can tell you what your blood pressure should beKeep your blood sugar in the target range, if you have diabetesLimit the amount of alcohol you drinkChoose foods that are healthy for your heart: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foodsLose weight if you are overweightBe physically activeDon't smokeNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"}
{"id": "doc19", "contents": "High Blood Pressure  What is blood pressure?Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.How is high blood pressure diagnosed?High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. He or she will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis.Blood Pressure CategorySystolic Blood PressureDiastolic Blood PressureNormalLess than 120andLess than 80High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors)140 or higheror90 or higherHigh Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers)130 or higheror80 or higherDangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away180 or higherand120 or higherFor children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex.What are the different types of high blood pressure?There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.:Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older.Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it.Why do I need to worry about high blood pressure?When your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure.What are the treatments for high blood pressure?Treatments for high blood pressure include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines.You will work with your provider to come up with a treatment plan. It may include only the lifestyle changes. These changes, such as heart-healthy eating and exercise, can be very effective. But sometimes the changes do not control or lower your high blood pressure. Then you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines. Some people need to take more than one type.If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, treating that condition or stopping the medicine may lower your blood pressure.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}

Common treatments include a diabetic meal plan, regular physical activity, and medicines. Some less common treatments are weight loss surgery for either type and an artificial pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.Who needs diabetes medicines?People with type 1 diabetes need to take a diabetes medicine called insulin to control their blood sugar.Some people with type 2 diabetes can control their blood sugar with healthy food choices and physical activity. But for others, a diabetic meal plan and physical activity are not enough. They need to take diabetes medicines.The kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes, daily schedule, medicine costs, and any other health conditions that you have. Over time, you may need to take more than one diabetes medicine.What are the types of medicines for type 1 diabetes?If you have type 1 diabetes, you must take insulin because your body no longer makes it. There are different types of insulin that start to work at different speeds, and the effects of each last a different length of time. Your health care provider will measure your blood glucose to decide on the type of insulin. You may need to use more than one type.You will also need to check your blood sugar at home.  Your provider will tell you how often. The results of your blood sugar testing can help you make decisions about food, physical activity, and medicines.You can take insulin several different ways. The most common are with a needle and syringe, an insulin pen, or an insulin pump. If you use a needle and syringe or a pen, you have to take insulin several times during the day, including with meals. An insulin pump gives you small, steady doses throughout the day. Less common ways to take insulin include inhalers, injection ports, and jet injectors.In rare cases, taking insulin alone might not be enough to manage your blood sugar. Then you would need to take another diabetes medicine.What are the types of medicines for type 2 diabetes?There are several different medicines for type 2 diabetes. Each works in a different way. Many of them are pills. There are also medicines that you inject under your skin, such as insulin.Over time, you may need more than one diabetes medicine to manage your blood sugar. You might add another diabetes medicine or switch to a combination medicine.  A combination medicine contains more than one type of diabetes medicine in the same pill. Some people with type 2 diabetes take both pills and injections.Even if you don't usually take insulin, you may need it at special times, such as during pregnancy or if you are in the hospital.What else should I know about taking medicines for diabetes?Even if you take medicines for diabetes, you still need to eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, take your other medicines, and get regular physical activity. These will help you manage your diabetes.It is important to make sure that you understand your diabetes treatment plan.

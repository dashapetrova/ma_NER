{"id": "doc1", "contents": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  What is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. Another name for it is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). CFS can often make you unable to do your usual activities. Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed.What causes chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?The cause of CFS is unknown. There may be more than one thing that causes it. It is possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness.Who is at risk for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?Anyone can get CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women have it more often that adult men. Whites are more likely than other races to get a diagnosis of CFS, but many people with CFS have not been diagnosed with it.What are the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?CFS symptoms can include:Severe fatigue that is not improved by restSleep problemsPost-exertional malaise (PEM), where your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activityProblems with thinking and concentratingPainDizzinessCFS can be unpredictable. Your symptoms may come and go. They may change over time - sometimes they might get better, and other times they may get worse.How is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) diagnosed?CFS can be difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test for CFS, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of CFS. He or she will do a thorough medical exam, including:Asking about your medical history and your family's medical historyAsking about your current illness, including your symptoms. Your doctor will want to know how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life.A thorough physical and mental status examBlood, urine, or other testsWhat are the treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?There is no cure or approved treatment for CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms. You, your family, and your health care provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not \"push and crash.\" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again.Since the process of developing a treatment plan and attending to self-care can be hard if you have CFS, it is important to have support from family members and friends.Don't try any new treatments without talking to your health care provider. Some treatments that are promoted as cures for CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}

It sometimes takes visits to several different health care providers to get a diagnosis. One problem is that there isn't a specific test for it. And the main symptoms, pain and fatigue, are common in many other conditions. Health care providers have to rule out other causes of the symptoms before making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. This is called making a differential diagnosis.TYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, including asking detailed questions about your symptomsA physical examX-rays and blood tests to rule out other conditionsThe guidelines for diagnosing fibromyalgia, which includeA history of widespread pain lasting more than 3 monthsPhysical symptoms including fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive (memory or thought) problemsThe number of areas throughout the body in which you had pain in the past weekWhat are the treatments for fibromyalgia?Not all health care providers are familiar with fibromyalgia and its treatment. You should see a doctor or team of health care providers who specialize in the treatment of fibromyalgia.Fibromyalgia is treated with a combination of treatments, which may include medicines, lifestyle changes, talk therapy, and complementary therapies:MedicinesOver-the-counter pain relieversPrescription medicines that were specifically approved to treat fibromyalgiaPrescription pain medicinesCertain antidepressants, which may help with pain or sleep problemsLifestyle changesGetting enough sleepGetting regular physical activity. If you have not already been active, start slowly and gradually increase how much activity you get. You may want to see a physical therapist, who can help you create a plan that is right for you.Learning how to manage stressEating a healthy dietLearning to pace yourself. If you do too much, it can make your symptoms worse. So you need to learn to balance being active with your need for rest.Talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you learn strategies to deal with pain, stress, and negative thoughts. If you also have depression along with your fibromyalgia, talk therapy can help with that too.Complementary therapies have helped some people with the symptoms of fibromyalgia.

They normally turn into working nerve cells. But in neuroblastoma, they form a tumor.Neuroblastoma usually begins in the adrenal glands. You have two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make important hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and the way the body reacts to stress. Neuroblastoma may also begin in the neck, chest or spinal cord.What causes neuroblastoma?Neuroblastoma is caused by mutations (changes) in genes. In most cases, the cause of the mutation is unknown. In some other cases, the mutation is passed from the parent to the child.What are the symptoms of neuroblastoma?Neuroblastoma often begins in early childhood. Sometimes it begins before a child is born.The most common symptoms are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone.They include:A lump in the abdomen, neck or chestBulging eyesDark circles around the eyesBone painSwollen stomach and trouble breathing in babiesPainless, bluish lumps under the skin in babiesInability to move a body part (paralysis)How is neuroblastoma diagnosed?To diagnose neuroblastoma, your child's health care provider will do various tests and procedures, which may include:A medical historyA neurological examImaging tests, such as x-rays, a CT scan, an ultrasound, an MRI, or an MIBG scan. In an MIBG scan, a small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein. It travels through the bloodstream and attaches itself to any neuroblastoma cells. A scanner detects the cells.Blood and urine testsBiopsy, where a sample of tissue is removed and examined under a microscopeBone marrow aspiration and biopsy, where bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone are removed for testingWhat are the treatments for neuroblastoma?The treatments for neuroblastoma include:Observation, also called watchful waiting, where the health care provider does not give any treatments until your child's signs or symptoms appear or changeSurgeryRadiation therapyChemotherapyHigh-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell rescue. Your child will get high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. This kills the cancer cells, but it also kills healthy cells. So your child will get a stem cell transplant, usually of his or her own cells collected earlier. This helps to replace the healthy cells that were lost.Iodine 131-MIBG therapy, a treatment with radioactive iodine.

{"id": "doc8", "contents": "Cancer  Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy, or stem cell transplantation.

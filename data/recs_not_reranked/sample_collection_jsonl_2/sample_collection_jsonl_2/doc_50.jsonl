The warts usually appear as a small bump or group of bumps in the genital area. They are flesh-colored and can be flat or look bumpy like cauliflower. Some genital warts are so small you cannot see them. In women, the warts usually occur in or around the vagina, on the cervix, or around the anus. In men, genital warts are less common. They may have warts on the tip of the penis, around the anus, or on the scrotum, thigh, or groin.You can get genital warts during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner.  Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex. HPV vaccines may help prevent some of the HPV infections that cause genital warts.Your health care provider usually diagnoses genital warts by seeing them. The warts might disappear on their own. If not, your health care provider can treat or remove them. HPV stays in your body even after treatment, so warts can come back.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health"}

CP affects the cerebral motor cortex. This is the part of the brain that directs muscle movement. In fact, the first part of the name, cerebral, means having to do with the brain. The second part, palsy, means weakness or problems with using the muscles.What are the types of cerebral palsy (CP)?There are different types of CP:Spastic cerebral palsy, which is the most common type. It causes increased muscle tone, stiff muscles, and awkward movements. Sometimes it only affects one part of the body. In other cases, it can affect both arms and legs, the trunk, and the face.Dyskinetic cerebral palsy, which causes problems controlling the movement of the hands, arms, feet, and legs. This can make it hard to sit and walk.Ataxic cerebral palsy, which causes problems with balance and coordinationMixed cerebral palsy, which means that you have symptoms of more than one typeWhat causes cerebral palsy (CP)?CP is caused by abnormal development or damage to the developing brain. It could happen when:The cerebral motor cortex doesn't develop normally during fetal growthThere is an injury to the brain before, during, or after birthBoth the brain damage and the disabilities it causes are permanent.Who is at risk for cerebral palsy (CP)?CP is more common among boys than girls. It affects black children more often than white children.Certain medical conditions or events that can happen during pregnancy and delivery that may increase a baby's risk of being born with cerebral palsy, including:Being born too smallBeing born too earlyBeing born a twin or other multiple birthBeing conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other assisted reproductive technology (ART)Having a mother who had an infection during pregnancyHaving a mother with certain health problems in pregnancy, such as thyroid problemsSevere jaundiceHaving complications during birthRh incompatibilitySeizuresExposure to toxinsWhat are the signs of cerebral palsy (CP)?There are many different types and levels of disability with CP. So the signs can be different in each child.The signs usually appear in the early months of life. But sometimes there is a delay in getting a diagnosis until after age two. Infants with CP often have developmental delays. They are slow to reach developmental milestones such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk. They may also have abnormal muscle tone. They may seem floppy, or they may be stiff or rigid.It's important to know that children without CP can also have these signs. Contact your child's health care provider know if your child has any of these signs, so you can get a correct diagnosis.How is cerebral palsy (CP) diagnosed?Diagnosing CP involves several steps:Developmental monitoring (or surveillance) means tracking a child's growth and development over time. If there are any concerns about your child's development, then he or she should have a developmental screening test as soon as possible.Developmental screening involves a giving your child a short test to check for motor, movement, or other developmental delays. If the screenings are not normal, the provider will recommend some evaluations.Developmental and medical evaluations are done to diagnose which disorder your child has.

{"id": "doc7", "contents": "Diabetes Complications  What is diabetes?If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.What health problems can diabetes cause?Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause complications, including:Eye disease, due to changes in fluid levels, swelling in the tissues, and damage to the blood vessels in the eyesFoot problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow to your feetGum disease and other dental problems, because a high amount of blood sugar in your saliva helps harmful bacteria grow in your mouth. The bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause gum disease and bad breath. Other types cause tooth decay and cavities.Heart disease and stroke, caused by damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vesselsKidney disease, due to damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys. Many people with diabetes develop high blood pressure. That can also damage your kidneys.Nerve problems (diabetic neuropathy), caused by damage to the nerves and the small blood vessels that nourish your nerves with oxygen and nutrientsSexual and bladder problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow in the genitals and bladderSkin conditions, some of which are caused by changes in the small blood vessels and reduced circulation. People with diabetes are also more likely to have infections, including skin infections.What other problems can people with diabetes have?If you have diabetes, you need to watch out for blood sugar levels that are very high (hyperglycemia) or very low (hypoglycemia). These can happen quickly and can become dangerous. Some of the causes include having another illness or infection and certain medicines. They can also happen if you don't get the right amount of diabetes medicines. To try to prevent these problems, make sure to take your diabetes medicines correctly, follow your diabetic diet, and check your blood sugar regularly.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"}

It can infect both men and women. Women can get chlamydia in the cervix, rectum, or throat. Men can get chlamydia in the urethra (inside the penis), rectum, or throat.How do you get chlamydia?You can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who has the infection. A woman can also pass chlamydia to her baby during childbirth.If you've had chlamydia and were treated in the past, you can get re-infected if you have unprotected sex with someone who has it.Who is at risk of getting chlamydia?Chlamydia is more common in young people, especially young women. You are more likely to get it if you don't consistently use a condom, or if you have multiple partners.What are the symptoms of chlamydia?Chlamydia doesn't usually cause any symptoms. So you may not realize that you have it. People with chlamydia who have no symptoms can still pass the disease to others. If you do have symptoms, they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with an infected partner.Symptoms in women include:Abnormal vaginal discharge, which may have a strong smellA burning sensation when urinatingPain during intercourseIf the infection spreads, you might get lower abdominal pain, pain during sex, nausea, or fever.Symptoms in men include:Discharge from your penisA burning sensation when urinatingBurning or itching around the opening of your penisPain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common)If the chlamydia infects the rectum (in men or women), it can cause rectal pain, discharge, and/or bleeding.How is chlamydia diagnosed?There are lab tests to diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine sample. For women, providers sometimes use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia.Who should be tested for chlamydia?You should go to your health provider for a test if you have symptoms of chlamydia, or if you have a partner who has a sexually transmitted disease. Pregnant women should get a test when they go to their first prenatal visit.People at higher risk should get checked for chlamydia every year:Sexually active women 25 and youngerOlder women who have new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted diseaseMen who have sex with men (MSM)What other problems can chlamydia cause?In women, an untreated infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause permanent damage to your reproductive system. This can lead to long-term pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Women who have had chlamydia infections more than once are at higher risk of serious reproductive health complications.Men often don't have health problems from chlamydia. Sometimes it can infect the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm). This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility.Both men and women can develop reactive arthritis because of a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens as a \"reaction\" to an infection in the body.Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. It may also make it more likely for your baby to be born too early.Untreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV/AIDS.What are the treatments for chlamydia?Antibiotics will cure the infection. You may get a one-time dose of the antibiotics, or you may need to take medicine every day for 7 days. Antibiotics cannot repair any permanent damage that the disease has caused.To prevent spreading the disease to your partner, you should not have sex until the infection has cleared up. If you got a one-time dose of antibiotics, you should wait 7 days after taking the medicine to have sex again. If you have to take medicine every day for 7 days, you should not have sex again until you have finished taking all of the doses of your medicine.It is common to get a repeat infection, so you should get tested again about three months after treatment.Can chlamydia be prevented?The only sure way to prevent chlamydia is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia.

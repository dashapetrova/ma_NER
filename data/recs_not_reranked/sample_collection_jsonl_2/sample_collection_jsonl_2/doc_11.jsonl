{"id": "doc1", "contents": "Hyperthyroidism  What is hyperthyroidism?Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs.Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. If not treated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with your heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle, and fertility. But there are treatments that can help.What causes hyperthyroidism?Hyperthyroidism has several causes. They include:Grave's disease, an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your thyroid and causes it to make too much hormone. This is the most common cause.Thyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults.Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland.Too much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.Too much thyroid medicine. This can happen if people who take thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) take too much of it.Who is at risk for hyperthyroidism?You are at higher risk for hyperthyroidism if you:Are a womanAre older than age 60Have been pregnant or had a baby within the past 6 monthsHave had thyroid surgery or a thyroid problem, such as goiterHave a family history of thyroid diseaseHave pernicious anemia, in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12Have type 1 diabetes or primary adrenal insufficiency, a hormonal disorderGet too much iodine, from eating large amounts of foods containing iodine or using iodine-containing medicines or supplementsWhat are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?The symptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include:Nervousness or irritabilityFatigueMuscle weaknessTrouble tolerating heatTrouble sleepingTremor, usually in your handsRapid and irregular heartbeatFrequent bowel movements or diarrheaWeight lossMood swingsGoiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing.Adults over age 60 may have different symptoms than younger adults. For example, they may lose their appetite or withdraw from other people. Sometimes this can be mistaken for depression or dementia.What other problems can hyperthyroidism cause?If hyperthyroidism isn't treated, it can cause some serious health problems, including:An irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure, and other heart problemsAn eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy. It can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and eye pain. In rare cases, it can lead to vision loss.Thinning bones and osteoporosisFertility problems in womenComplications in pregnancy, such as premature birth, low birth weight, high blood pressure in pregnancy, and miscarriageHow is hyperthyroidism diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, including asking about symptomsA physical examThyroid tests, such as"}

{"id": "doc9", "contents": "Heart Health Tests  Heart diseases are the number one killer in the U.S. They are also a major cause of disability. If you do have a heart disease, it is important to find it early, when it is easier to treat. Blood tests and heart health tests can help find heart diseases or identify problems that can lead to heart diseases. There are several different types of heart health tests. Your doctor will decide which test or tests you need, based on your symptoms (if any), risk factors, and medical history.Cardiac CatheterizationCardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. For the procedure, your doctor puts a catheter (a long, thin, flexible tube) into a blood vessel in your arm, groin, or neck, and threads it to your heart. The doctor can use the catheter to:Do a coronary angiography. This involves putting a special type of dye in the catheter, so the dye can flow through your bloodstream to your heart. Then your doctor takes x-rays of your heart. The dye allows your doctor to see your coronary arteries on the x-ray, and to check for coronary artery disease (plaque buildup in the arteries).Take samples of blood and heart muscleDo procedures such as minor heart surgery or angioplasty, if your doctor finds that you need itCardiac CT ScanA cardiac CT (computed tomography) scan is a painless imaging test that uses x-rays to take detailed pictures of your heart and its blood vessels. Computers can combine these pictures to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of the whole heart. This test can help doctors detect or evaluate:Coronary artery diseaseCalcium buildup in the coronary arteriesProblems with the aortaProblems with heart function and valvesPericardial diseasesBefore you have the test, you get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. The CT scanner is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the scanner, and the scanner takes the pictures for about 15 minutes.Cardiac MRICardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a painless imaging test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your heart. It can help your doctor figure out whether you have heart disease, and if so, how severe it is. A cardiac MRI can also help your doctor decide the best way to treat heart problems such as:Coronary artery diseaseHeart valve problemsPericarditisCardiac tumorsDamage from a heart attackThe MRI is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the MRI machine. The machine makes loud noises as it takes pictures of your heart. It usually takes about 30-90 minutes. Sometimes before the test, you might get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures.Chest X-RayA chest x-ray creates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. It can reveal signs of heart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to heart disease.Coronary AngiographyCoronary angiography (angiogram) is a procedure that uses contrast dye and x-ray pictures to look at the insides of your arteries. It can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is. Doctors use this procedure to diagnose heart diseases after chest pain, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), or abnormal results from other heart tests such as an EKG or a stress test.You usually have a cardiac catheterization to get the dye into your coronary arteries. Then you have special x-rays while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.EchocardiographyEchocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working. Doctors use an echo to diagnose many different heart problems, and to check how severe they are.For the test, a technician applies gel to your chest. The gel helps sound waves reach your heart. The technician moves a transducer (wand-like device) around on your chest. The transducer connects to a computer. It transmits ultrasound waves into your chest, and the waves bounce (echo) back. The computer converts the echoes into pictures of your heart.Electrocardiogram (EKG), (ECG)An electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular.An EKG may be part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease. Or you may get it to detect and study heart problems such as heart attacks, arrhythmia, and heart failure.For the test, you lie still on a table and a nurse or technician attaches electrodes (patches that have sensors) to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity.Stress TestingStress testing looks at how your heart works during physical stress. It can help to diagnose coronary artery disease, and to check how severe it is. It can also check for other problems, including heart valve disease and heart failure.For the test, you exercise (or are given medicine if you are unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. While this is happening, you get an EKG and blood pressure monitoring. Sometimes you may also have an echocardiogram, or other imaging tests such as a nuclear scan. For the nuclear scan, you get an injection of a tracer (a radioactive substance), which travels to your heart. Special cameras detect the energy from the tracer to make pictures of your heart. You have pictures taken after you exercise, and then after you rest.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}

Along with the adenoids, tonsils are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance.  Tonsils and adenoids work by trapping the germs coming in through the mouth and nose.What is tonsillitis?Tonsillitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils. Sometimes along with tonsillitis, the adenoids are also swollen.What causes tonsillitis?The cause of tonsillitis is usually a viral infection. Bacterial infections such as strep throat can also cause tonsillitis.Who is at risk for tonsillitis?Tonsillitis is most common in children over age two. Almost every child in the United States gets it at least once. Tonsillitis caused by bacteria is more common in kids ages 5-15. Tonsillitis caused by a virus is more common in younger children.Adults can get tonsillitis, but it is not very common.Is tonsillitis contagious?Although tonsillitis is not contagious, the viruses and bacteria that cause it are contagious. Frequent handwashing can help prevent spreading or catching the infections.What are the symptoms of tonsillitis?The symptoms of tonsillitis include:A sore throat, which may be severeRed, swollen tonsilsTrouble swallowingA white or yellow coating on the tonsilsSwollen glands in the neckFeverBad breathWhen does my child need to see a health care provider for tonsillitis?You should call your health care provider if your child:Has a sore throat for more than two daysHas trouble or pain when swallowingFeels very sick or very weakYou should get emergency care right away if your child:Has trouble breathingStarts droolingHas a lot of trouble swallowingHow is tonsillitis diagnosed?To diagnose tonsillitis, your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes.Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep.What are the treatments for tonsillitis?Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take antibiotics. It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child.No matter what is causing the tonsillitis, there are some things you can do to help your child feel better. Make sure that your child:Gets a lot of restDrinks plenty of fluidsTries eating soft foods if it hurts to swallowTries eating warm liquids or cold foods like popsicles to soothe the throatIsn't around cigarette smoke or do anything else that could irritate the throatSleeps in a room with a humidifierGargles with saltwaterSucks on a lozenge (but do not give them to children under four; they can choke on them)Takes an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin.In some cases, your child may need a tonsillectomy.What is a tonsillectomy and why might my child need one?A tonsillectomy is surgery to remove the tonsils. Your child might need it if he or she:Keeps getting tonsillitisHas bacterial tonsillitis that does not get better with antibioticsHas tonsils are too big, and are causing trouble breathing or swallowingYour child usually gets the surgery and goes home later that day. Very young children and people who have complications may need to stay in the hospital overnight. It can take a week or two before your child completely recovers from the surgery."}

They, along with the tonsils, are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids and tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose.Adenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost completely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs.What are enlarged adenoids? Enlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in children.What causes enlarged adenoids?Your child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.What problems can enlarged adenoids cause?Enlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose.  Your child might end up breathing only through the mouth. This may cause:A dry mouth, which can also lead to bad breathCracked lipsA runny noseOther problems that enlarged adenoids can cause include:Loud breathingSnoringRestless sleepSleep apnea, a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing fduring sleepEar infectionsHow can enlarged adenoids be diagnosed?Your child's health care provider will take a medical history, check your child's ears, throat, and mouth, and feel your child's neck.Since the adenoids are higher up than the throat, the provider cannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth.  To check the size of your child's adenoids, your provider may use:A special mirror in the mouthA long, flexible tube with a light (an endoscope)An x-rayWhat are the treatments for enlarged adenoids?The treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are not too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may get nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a bacterial infection.In some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy.What is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one?An adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. The provider may recommend this surgery if:Your child has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear.Antibiotics can't get rid of a bacterial infection of the adenoids.The enlarged adenoids block the airways.If there is also a problem with the tonsils, your child will probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that the adenoids are removed.After having the surgery, your child usually goes home the same day. Your child will probably have some throat pain, bad breath, and a runny nose. It can take several days to feel all better."}

Most birth defects happen during the first 3 months of pregnancy. One out of every 33 babies in the United States is born with a birth defect.A birth defect may affect how the body looks, works, or both. Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, like heart disease, are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. How a birth defect affects a child's life depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved and how severe the defect is.What causes birth defects?For some birth defects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors, which can include:Genetics. One or more genes might have a change or mutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile X syndrome. With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing.Chromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might be missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome. In other cases, such as with Down syndrome, the child has an extra chromosome. Exposures to medicines, chemicals, or other toxic substances. For example, alcohol misuse can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.Infections during pregnancy. For example, infection with Zika virus during pregnancy can cause a serious defect in the brain.Lack of certain nutrients. Not getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy is a key factor in causing neural tube defects.Who is at risk of having a baby with birth defects?Certain factors may might increase the chances of having a baby with a birth defect, such as:Smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking certain \"street\" drugs during pregnancyHaving certain medical conditions, such as obesity or uncontrolled diabetes, before and during pregnancyTaking certain medicinesHaving someone in your family with a birth defect. To learn more about your risk of having a baby with a birth defect, you can talk with a genetic counselor,Being an older mother, typically over the age of 34 yearsHow are birth defects diagnosed?Health care providers can diagnose some birth defects during pregnancy, using prenatal testing.  That's why it important to get regular prenatal care.Other birth defects may not be found until after the baby is born. Providers may find them through newborn screening. Some defects, such as club foot, are obvious right away. Other times, the health care provider may not discover a defect until later in life, when the child has symptoms.What are the treatments for birth defects?Children with birth defects often need special care and treatments. Because the symptoms and problems caused by birth defects vary, the treatments also vary. Possible treatments may include surgery, medicines, assistive devices, physical therapy, and speech therapy.Often, children with birth defects need a variety of services and may need to see several specialists. The primary health care provider can coordinate the special care that the child needs.Can birth defects be prevented?Not all birth defects can be prevented. But there are things you can do before and during pregnancy to increase your chance of having a healthy baby:Start prenatal care as soon as you think you might be pregnant, and see your health care provider regularly during pregnancyGet 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day. If possible, you should start taking it at least one month before you get pregnant.Don't drink alcohol, smoke, or use \"street\" drugsTalk to your health care provider about any medicines you are taking or thinking about taking.

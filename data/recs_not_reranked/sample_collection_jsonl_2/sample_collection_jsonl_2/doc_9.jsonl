About half of people who have a mental disorder will also have a substance use disorder at some point in their lives and vice versa. The interactions of the two conditions can worsen both.Why do substance use disorders and mental disorders occur together?Although these problems often occur together, this does not mean that one caused the other, even if one appeared first. In fact, it can be hard to figure out which came first. Researchers think that there are three possibilities as to why they occur together:Common risk factors may contribute to both mental disorders and substance use disorders. These factors include genetics, stress, and trauma.Mental disorders can contribute to drug use and substance use disorders. For example, people with mental disorders may use drugs or alcohol to try to feel better temporarily. This is known as self-medication. Also, mental disorders may change the brain to make it more likely you will become addicted.Substance use and addiction can contribute to the development of a mental disorder. Substance use may change the brain in ways that make you more likely to develop a mental disorder.What are the treatments for dual diagnosis?Someone with a dual diagnosis must treat both conditions. For the treatment to be effective, you need to stop using alcohol or drugs. Treatments may include behavioral therapies and medicines. Also, support groups can give you emotional and social support.

But medicines can also cause harmful reactions if not used correctly. Errors can happen in the hospital, at the health care provider's office, at the pharmacy, or at home.  You can help prevent errors by:Knowing your medicines. When you get a prescription, ask the name of the medicine and check to make sure that the pharmacy gave you the right medicine. Make sure that you understand how often you should take the medicine and how long you should take it.Keeping a list of medicines.Write down all of the medicines that you are taking, including the names of your medicines, how much you take, and when you take them. Make sure to include any over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, supplements, and herbs that you take.List the medicines that you are allergic to or that have caused you problems in the past.Take this list with you every time you see a health care provider.Reading medicine labels and following the directions. Don't just rely on your memory - read the medication label every time.  Be especially careful when giving medicines to children.Asking questions. If you don't know the answers to these questions, ask your health care provider or pharmacist:Why am I taking this medicine?What are the common side effects?What should I do if I have side effects?When should I stop this medicine?Can I take this medicine with the other medicines and supplements on my list?Do I need to avoid certain foods or alcohol while taking this medicine?Food and Drug Administration"}

They include strong prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.A health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some health care providers prescribe them for chronic pain.Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your health care provider. However, opioid misuse and addiction are still potential risks.What are opioid misuse and addiction?Opioid misuse means you are not taking the medicines according to your provider's instructions, you are using them to get high, or you are taking someone else's opioids. Addiction is a chronic brain disease. It causes you to compulsively seek out drugs even though they cause you harm.What are the treatments for opioid misuse and addiction?Treatments for opioid misuse and addiction include:MedicinesCounseling and behavioral therapiesMedication-assisted therapy (MAT), which includes medicines, counseling, and behavioral therapies. This offers a \"whole patient\" approach to treatment, which can increase your chance of a successful recovery.Residential and hospital-based treatmentWhich medicines treat opioid misuse and addiction?The medicines used to treat opioid misuse and addiction are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.Methadone and buprenorphine can decrease withdrawal symptoms and cravings. They work by acting on the same targets in the brain as other opioids, but they do not make you feel high. Some people worry that if they take methadone or buprenorphine, it means that they are substituting one addiction for another. But it is not; these medicines are a treatment. They restore balance to the parts of the brain affected by addiction. This allows your brain to heal while you work toward recovery.There is also a combination drug that includes buprenorphine and naloxone. Naloxone is a drug to treat an opioid overdose. If you take it along with buprenorphine, you will be less likely to misuse the buprenorphine.You may safely take these medicines for months, years, or even a lifetime. If you want to stop taking them, do not do it on your own. You should contact your health care provider first, and work out a plan for stopping.Naltrexone works differently than methadone and buprenorphine. It does not help you with withdrawal symptoms or cravings. Instead, it takes away the high that you would normally get when you take opioids. Because of this, you would take naltrexone to prevent a relapse, not to try to get off opioids. You have to be off opioids for at least 7-10 days before you can take naltrexone. Otherwise you could have bad withdrawal symptoms.How does counseling treat opioid misuse and addiction?Counseling for opioid misuse and addiction can help you:Change your attitudes and behaviors related to drug useBuild healthy life skillsStick with other forms of treatment, such as medicinesThere are different types of counseling to treat opioid misuse and addiction, including:Individual counseling, which may include setting goals, talking about setbacks, and celebrating progress. You may also talk about legal concerns and family problems. Counseling often includes specific behavioral therapies, such asCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you recognize and stop negative patterns of thinking and behavior. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and change the thoughts that cause you to want to misuse opioids.Motivational enhancement therapy helps you build up motivation to stick with your treatment planContingency management focuses on giving you incentives for positive behaviors such as staying off the opioidsGroup counseling, which can help you feel that you are not alone with your issues. You get a chance to hear about the difficulties and successes of others who have the same challenges. This can help you to learn new strategies for dealing with the situations you may come across.Family counseling/ includes partners or spouses and other family members who are close to you. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships.Counselors can also refer you to other resources that you might need, such as:Peer support groups, including 12-step programs like Narcotics AnonymousSpiritual and faith-based groupsHIV testing and hepatitis screeningCase or care managementEmployment or educational supportsOrganizations that help you find housing or transportationWhat are residential and hospital-based treatments for opioid misuse and addiction?Residential programs combine housing and treatment services. You are living with your peers, and you can support each other to stay in recovery. Inpatient hospital-based programs combine health care and addiction treatment services for people with medical problems. Hospitals may also offer intensive outpatient treatment. All these types of treatments are very structured, and usually include several different kinds of counseling and behavioral therapies. They also often include medicines."}

Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence.AUD is a disease that causes:Craving - a strong need to drinkLoss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've startedNegative emotional state - feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinkingWhat is binge drinking?Binge drinking is drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one.What are the dangers of too much alcohol?Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to liver diseases, such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your baby. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide.How do I know if I have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)?You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions:In the past year, have you:Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to?Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn't?Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking?Felt a strong need to drink?Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school?Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink?Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking?

The top of your upper arm bone is shaped like a ball. This ball fits into a cuplike socket in your shoulder blade. A shoulder dislocation is an injury that happens when the ball pops out of your socket. A dislocation may be partial, where the ball is only partially out of the socket. It can also be a full dislocation, where the ball is completely out of the socket.What causes a dislocated shoulder?Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They are also the most commonly dislocated joints.The most common causes of shoulder dislocations are:Sports injuriesAccidents, including traffic accidentsFalling on your shoulder or outstretched armSeizures and electric shocks, which can cause muscle contractions that pull the arm out of placeWho is at risk for a dislocated shoulder?A dislocated shoulder can happen to anyone, but they are more common in young men, who are more often involved in sports and other physical activities. Older adults, especially women, are also at higher risk because they are more likely to fall.What are the symptoms of a dislocated shoulder?The symptoms of a dislocated shoulder include:Severe shoulder painSwelling and bruising of your shoulder or upper armNumbness and/or weakness in your arm, neck, hand, or fingersTrouble moving your armYour arm seems to be out of placeMuscle spasms in your shoulderIf you are having these symptoms, get medical treatment right away.How is a dislocated shoulder diagnosed?To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will take a medical history and examine your shoulder. Your provider may also ask you to get an x-ray to confirm the diagnosis.What are the treatments for a dislocated shoulder?The treatment for dislocated shoulder usually involves three steps:The first step is a closed reduction, a procedure in which your health care provider puts the ball of your upper arm back into the socket. You may first get medicine to relieve the pain and relax your shoulder muscles. Once the joint is back in place, the severe pain should end.The second step is wearing a sling or other device to keep your shoulder in place. You will wear it for a few days to several weeks.The third step is rehabilitation, once the pain and swelling have improved. You will do exercises to improve your range of motion and strengthen your muscles.You may need surgery if you injure the tissues or nerves around the shoulder or if you get repeated dislocations.A dislocation can make your shoulder unstable. When that happens, it takes less force to dislocate it. This means that there is a higher risk of it happening again.

{"id": "doc11", "contents": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy  What is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of genetic diseases that damages and kills motor neurons. Motor neurons are a type of nerve cell in the spinal cord and lower part of the brain. They control movement in your arms, legs, face, chest, throat, and tongue.As the motor neurons die off, your muscles start to weaken and atrophy (waste away). The muscle damage gets worse over time and can affect speaking, walking, swallowing, and breathing.What are the types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and what are their symptoms?There are different types of SMA. They are based on how serious the disease is and when the symptoms start:Type l is also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease or infantile-onset SMA. It is the most severe type. It is also the most common. Babies with this type usually show signs of the disease before 6 months of age. In more severe cases, the signs show up even before or just after birth (Types 0 or 1A). The babies may have trouble swallowing and breathing and may not move around a lot. They have chronic shortening of muscles or tendons (called contractures). They usually cannot sit up without help. Without treatment, many children with this type will die before 2 years of age.Type ll is a moderate to severe type of SMA. It usually first noticed between 6 and 18 months of age. Most children with this type can sit without support but cannot stand or walk without help. They may also have trouble breathing. They can usually live into adolescence or young adulthood.Type lll is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease. It is the mildest type that affects children. The signs of the disease usually show up after age 18 months. Children with this type can walk by themselves but may have trouble running, getting up from a chair, or climbing stairs. They may also have scoliosis (curvature of the spine), contractures, and respiratory infections. With treatment, most children with this type will have a normal lifespan.Type IV is rare and often mild. It usually causes symptoms after 21 years of age. The symptoms include mild to moderate leg muscle weakness, tremors, and mild breathing problems. The symptoms slowly get worse over time. People with this type of SMA have a normal lifespan.What causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?Most types of SMA are caused by a change in the SMN1 gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein that the motor neurons need to be healthy and to function. But when part of the SMN1 gene is missing or abnormal, there isn't enough protein for the motor neurons. This causes the motor neurons to die off.Most people have two copies of the SM1 gene - one from each parent. SMA normally only happens when both copies have the gene change. If only one copy has the change, there usually aren't any symptoms. But that gene could be passed down from parent to child.Some of the less common types of SMA may be caused by changes in other genes.How is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose SMA:A physical examA medical history, including asking about family historyGenetic testing to check for the gene changes that cause SMAElectromyography and nerve conduction studies and a muscle biopsy may be done, especially if no gene changes were foundParents who have a family history of SMA may want to do a prenatal test to check to see whether their baby has an SMN1 gene change. An amniocentesis or in some cases a chorionic villi sampling (CVS) is used to get the sample for testing.In some states, genetic testing for SMA is part of newborn screening tests.What are the treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?There is no cure for SMA. Treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. They may include:Medicines to help the body make more of the proteins that the motor neurons needGene therapy for children under 2 years of agePhysical, occupational, and rehabilitation therapy to help to improve posture and the mobility of the joints. These therapies may also improve blood flow and slow muscle weakness and atrophy. Some people may also need therapy for trouble speaking, chewing, and swallowing.Assistive devices such as supports or braces, orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs to help people stay more independentGood nutrition and a balanced diet to help maintain weight and strength. Some people might need a feeding tube in order to get the nutrition they need.Breathing support for people who have muscle weakness in the neck, throat, and chest.

You usually don't have any other symptoms. In many cases, it does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. But it does raise your risk of high blood pressure in the future. It sometimes can be severe, which may lead to low birth weight or preterm birth. Some women with gestational hypertension do go on to develop preeclampsia.Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that started before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some women may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn't know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia.Preeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. In rare cases, symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. Preeclampsia also includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidney.

It is rare, but very serious.What are the symptoms of preeclampsia?Possible symptoms of preeclampsia include:High blood pressureToo much protein in your urine (called proteinuria)Swelling in your face and hands. Your feet may also swell, but many women have swollen feet during pregnancy. So swollen feet by themselves may not be a sign of a problem.Headache that does not go awayVision problems, including blurred vision or seeing spotsPain in your upper right abdomenTrouble breathingEclampsia can also cause seizures, nausea and/or vomiting, and low urine output. If you go on to develop HELLP syndrome, you may also have bleeding or bruising easily, extreme fatigue, and liver failure.How is preeclampsia diagnosed?Your health care provider will check your blood pressure and urine at each prenatal visit. If your blood pressure reading is high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, your provider will likely want to run some tests. They may include blood tests other lab tests to look for extra protein in the urine as well as other symptoms.What are the treatments for preeclampsia?Delivering the baby can often cure preeclampsia. When making a decision about treatment, your provider take into account several factors. They include how severe it is, how many weeks pregnant you are, and what the potential risks to you and your baby are:If you are more than 37 weeks pregnant, your provider will likely want to deliver the baby.If you are less than 37 weeks pregnant, your health care provider will closely monitor you and your baby. This includes blood and urine tests for you. Monitoring for the baby often involves ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, and checking on the baby's growth. You may need to take medicines, to control your blood pressure and to prevent seizures. Some women also get steroid injections, to help the baby's lungs mature faster. If the preeclampsia is severe, you provider may want you to deliver the baby early.The symptoms usually go away within 6 weeks of delivery. In rare cases, symptoms may not go away, or they may not start until after delivery (postpartum preeclampsia). This can be very serious, and it needs to be treated right away."}

Phe is an amino acid, a building block of proteins. It is in almost all foods. If your Phe level gets too high, it can damage your brain and cause severe intellectual disability.  All babies born in U.S. hospitals must now have a screening test for PKU. This makes it easier to diagnose and treat the problem early. The best treatment for PKU is a diet of low-protein foods. There are special formulas for newborns.  For older children and adults, the diet includes many fruits and vegetables. It also includes some low-protein breads, pastas, and cereals.

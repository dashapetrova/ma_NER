{"id": "doc1", "contents": "Drug Reactions  Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions, such as drug interactions, side effects, and allergies.What is a drug interaction?A drug interaction is a change in the way a drug acts in the body when taken with certain other drugs, foods, or supplements or when taken while you have certain medical conditions. Examples include:Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinnersDrugs and food, such as statins and grapefruitDrugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinnersDrugs and medical conditions, such as aspirin and peptic ulcersInteractions could cause a drug to be more or less effective, cause side effects, or change the way one or both drugs work.What are side effects?Side effects are unwanted, usually unpleasant, effects caused by medicines. Most are mild, such as a stomachache, dry mouth, or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the medicine.  Others can be more serious. Sometimes a drug can interact with a disease that you have and cause a side effect. For example, if you have a heart condition, certain decongestants can cause you to have a rapid heartbeat.What are drug allergies?Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can range from mild to life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is less common.How can I stay safe when taking medicines?When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medicine, make sure you understand how to take it correctly. Know which other medicines, foods, and supplements you need to avoid. Always talk to your health care provider or pharmacist if you have questions about your medicines."}
{"id": "doc2", "contents": "Antibiotics  What are antibiotics?Antibiotics are medicines that fight bacterial infections in people and animals. They work by killing the bacteria or by making it hard for the bacteria to grow and multiply.Antibiotics can be taken in different ways:Orally (by mouth). This could be pills, capsules, or liquids.Topically. This might be a cream, spray, or ointment that you put on your skin. It could also be eye ointment, eye drops, or ear drops.Through an injection or intravenously (IV). This is usually for more serious infections.What do antibiotics treat?Antibiotics only treat certain bacterial infections, such as strep throat, urinary tract infections, and E. coli.You may not need to take antibiotics for some bacterial infections. For example, you might not need them for many sinus infections or some ear infections. Taking antibiotics when they're not needed won't help you, and they can have side effects. Your health care provider can decide the best treatment for you when you're sick. Don't ask your provider to prescribe an antibiotic for you.Do antibiotics treat viral infections?Antibiotics do not work on viral infections. For example, you shouldn't take antibiotics for:Colds and runny noses, even if the mucus is thick, yellow, or greenMost sore throats (except strep throat)FluMost cases of bronchitisWhat are the side effects of antibiotics?The side effects of antibiotics range from minor to very severe. Some of the common side effects include:RashNauseaDiarrheaYeast infectionsMore serious side effects can include:C. diff infections, which cause diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and sometimes even deathSevere and life-threatening allergic reactionsAntibiotic resistance infectionsCall your health care provider if you develop any side effects while taking your antibiotic.Why is it important to take antibiotics only when they're needed?You should only take antibiotics when they are needed because they can cause side effects and can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance happens when the bacteria change and become able to resist the effects of an antibiotic. This means that the bacteria continue to grow.How do I use antibiotics correctly?When you take antibiotics, it is important that you take them responsibly:Always follow the directions carefully. Finish your medicine even if you feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect you.Don't save your antibiotics for later.Don't share your antibiotic with others.Don't take antibiotics prescribed for someone else.

It affects an area of the spinal cord called gray matter. This can cause the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak.Because of these symptoms, some people call AFM a \"polio-like\" illness. But since 2014, people with AFM have been tested, and they did not have poliovirus.What causes acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Researchers think that viruses, including enteroviruses, likely play a role in causing AFM.  Most people with AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever (like you would get from a viral infection) before they got AFM.Who is at risk for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Anyone can get AFM, but most cases (more than 90%) have been in young children.What are the symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Most people with AFM will suddenly have:Arm or leg weaknessA loss of muscle tone and reflexesSome people also have other symptoms, including:Facial drooping/weaknessTrouble moving the eyesDrooping eyelidsTrouble swallowingSlurred speechPain in the arms, legs, back, or neckSometimes AFM can weaken the muscles that you need for breathing. This can lead to respiratory failure, which is very serious. If you get respiratory failure, you may need to use a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe.If you or your child develops any of these symptoms, you should get medical care right away.How is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) diagnosed?AFM causes many of the same symptoms as other neurologic diseases, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. This can make it difficult to diagnose. The doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A neurologic exam, including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexesAn MRI to look at the spinal cord and brainLab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord)Nerve conduction and electromyography (EMG) studies. These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start.What are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?There is no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms. For example, physical and/or occupational therapy may help with arm or leg weakness. Researchers do not know the long-term outcomes of people with AFM.Can acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) be prevented?Since viruses likley play a role in AFM, you should take steps to help prevent getting or spreading viral infections by:Washing hands often with soap and waterAvoiding touching your face with unwashed handsAvoiding close contact with people who are sickCleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toysCovering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not handsStaying home when sickCenters for Disease Control and Prevention"}

{"id": "doc7", "contents": "Sickle Cell Disease  What is sickle cell disease (SCD)?Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. If you have SCD, there is a problem with your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood cells. This changes the shape of the red blood cells. The cells are supposed to be disc-shaped, but this changes them into a crescent, or sickle, shape.The sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The sickle cells usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new cells to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood cells. This is a condition called anemia, and it can make you feel tired.The sickle-shaped cells can also stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen can't reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These attacks can occur without warning. If you get one, you might need to go to the hospital for treatment.What causes sickle cell disease (SCD)?The cause of SCD is a defective gene, called a sickle cell gene. People with the disease are born with two sickle cell genes, one from each parent.If you are born with one sickle cell gene, it's called sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy, but they can pass the defective gene on to their children.Who is at risk for sickle cell disease (SCD)?In the United States, most of the people with SCD are African Americans:About 1 in 13 African American babies is born with sickle cell traitAbout 1 in every 365 black children is born with sickle cell diseaseSCD also affects some people who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.What are the symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD)?People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Early symptoms of SCD may include:Painful swelling of the hands and feetFatigue or fussiness from anemiaA yellowish color of the skin (jaundice) or the whites of the eyes (icterus)The effects of SCD vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. They may include severe pain, anemia, organ damage, and infections.How is sickle cell disease (SCD) diagnosed?A blood test can show if you have SCD or sickle cell trait. All states now test newborns as part of their screening programs, so treatment can begin early.People who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD.Doctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby).What are the treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD)?The only cure for SCD is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister.There are treatments that can help relieve symptoms, lessen complications, and prolong life:Antibiotics to try to prevent infections in younger childrenPain relievers for acute or chronic painHydroxyurea, a medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications. It increases the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood. This medicine is not right for everyone; talk to your health care provider about whether you should take it. This medicine is not safe during pregnancy.Childhood vaccinations to prevent infectionsBlood transfusions for severe anemia. If you have had some serious complications, such as a stroke, you may have transfusions to prevent more complications.There are other treatments for specific complications.To stay as healthy as possible, make sure that you get regular medical care, live a healthy lifestyle, and avoid situations that may set off a pain crisis.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}

Normally, there is a process in which your bones break down and then regrow. In Paget's disease, this process is abnormal. There is excessive breakdown and regrowth of bone. Because the bones regrow too quickly, they are bigger and softer than normal. They may be misshapen and easily fractured (broken). Paget's usually affects just one or a few bones.What causes Paget's disease of bone?Researchers do not know for sure what causes Paget's disease. Environmental factors may play a role. In some cases, the disease runs in families, and several genes have been linked to the disease.Who is at risk for Paget's disease of bone?The disease is more common in older people and those of northern European heritage. If you have a close relative who has Paget's, you are much more likely to have it.What are the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone?Many people do not know that they have Paget's, because it often has no symptoms.

It does not spread to normal bones.What other problems can Paget's disease of bone cause?Paget's disease can lead to other complications, such as:Arthritis, because the misshapen bones can cause increased pressure and more wear and tear on the jointsHeart failure. In severe Paget's disease, the heart has to work harder to pump blood to affected bones. Heart failure is more likely if you also have hardening of the arteries.Kidney stones, which can happen when the excessive breakdown of the bone leads to extra calcium in the bodyNervous system problems, since the bones can cause pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or nerves.

Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. Vitamin D also has a role in your nervous, muscle, and immune systems.You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. But too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer, so many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.How much vitamin D do I need?The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age.  The recommended amounts, in international units (IU), are:Birth to 12 months: 400 IUChildren 1-13 years: 600 IUTeens 14-18 years: 600 IUAdults 19-70 years: 600 IUAdults 71 years and older: 800 IUPregnant and breastfeeding women: 600 IUPeople at high risk of vitamin D deficiency may need more. Check with your health care provider about how much you need.What causes vitamin D deficiency?You can become deficient in vitamin D for different reasons:You don't get enough vitamin D in your dietYou don't absorb enough vitamin D from food (a malabsorption problem)You don't get enough exposure to sunlight.Your liver or kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form in the body.You take medicines that interfere with your body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin DWho is at risk of vitamin D deficiency?Some people are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency:Breastfed infants, because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. If you are breastfeeding, give your infant a supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D every day.Older adults, because your skin doesn't make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight as efficiently as when you were young, and your kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form.People with dark skin, which has less ability to produce vitamin D from the sun.People with disorders such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease who don't handle fat properly, because vitamin D needs fat to be absorbed.People who have obesity, because their body fat binds to some vitamin D and prevents it from getting into the blood.People who have had gastric bypass surgeryPeople with osteoporosisPeople with chronic kidney or liver disease.People with hyperparathyroidism (too much of a hormone that controls the body's calcium level)People with sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or other granulomatous disease (disease with granulomas, collections of cells caused by chronic inflammation)People with some lymphomas, a type of cancer.People who take medicines that affect vitamin D metabolism, such as cholestyramine (a cholesterol drug), anti-seizure drugs, glucocorticoids, antifungal drugs, and HIV/AIDS medicines.Talk with your health care provider if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  There is a blood test which can measure how much vitamin D is in your body.What problems does vitamin D deficiency cause?Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density, which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures (broken bones).Severe vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases. In children, it can cause rickets. Rickets is a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. African American infants and children are at higher risk of getting rickets. In adults, severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia. Osteomalacia causes weak bones, bone pain, and muscle weakness.Researchers are studying vitamin D for its possible connections to several medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis. They need to do more research before they can understand the effects of vitamin D on these conditions.How can I get more vitamin D?There are a few foods that naturally have some vitamin D:Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerelBeef liverCheeseMushroomsEgg yolksYou can also get vitamin D from fortified foods. You can check the food labels to find out whether a food has vitamin D. Foods that often have added vitamin D include:MilkBreakfast cerealsOrange juiceOther dairy products, such as yogurtSoy drinksVitamin D is in many multivitamins. There are also vitamin D supplements, both in pills and a liquid for babies.If you have vitamin D deficiency, the treatment is with supplements. Check with your health care provider about how much you need to take, how often you need to take it, and how long you need to take it.Can too much vitamin D be harmful?Getting too much vitamin D (known as vitamin D toxicity) can be harmful. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys. Too much vitamin D also raises the level of calcium in your blood. High levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm.Most cases of vitamin D toxicity happen when someone overuses vitamin D supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces."}

{"id": "doc12", "contents": "Fatty Liver Disease  What is fatty liver disease?Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. There are two main types:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)Alcoholic fatty liver disease, also called alcoholic steatohepatitisWhat is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)?NAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds:Simple fatty liver, in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications.Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.What is alcoholic fatty liver disease?Alcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink, so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, promote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink, the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.Who is at risk for fatty liver disease?The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unknown. Researchers do know that it is more common in people who:Have type 2 diabetes and prediabetesHave obesityAre middle aged or older (although children can also get it)Are Hispanic, followed by non-Hispanic whites. It is less common in African Americans.Have high levels of fats in the blood, such as cholesterol and triglyceridesHave high blood pressureTake certain drugs, such as corticosteroids and some cancer drugsHave certain metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndromeHave rapid weight lossHave certain infections, such as hepatitis CHave been exposed to some toxinsNAFLD affects about 25% of people in the world. As the rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol are rising in the United States, so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States.Alcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers, especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women, have obesity, or have certain genetic mutations.What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease?Both NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease are usually silent diseases with few or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may feel tired or have discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen.How is fatty liver disease diagnosed?Because there are often no symptoms, it is not easy to find fatty liver disease. Your doctor may suspect that you have it if you get abnormal results on liver tests that you had for other reasons. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will use:Your medical historyA physical examVarious tests, including blood and imaging tests, and sometimes a biopsyAs part of the medical history, your doctor will ask about your alcohol use, to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take, to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD.During the physical exam, your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease, such as:An enlarged liverSigns of cirrhosis, such as jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellowYou will likely have blood tests, including liver function tests and blood count tests. In some cases you may also have imaging tests, like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis, which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is.What are the treatments for fatty liver disease?Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss can reduce fat in the liver, inflammation, and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD, you should stop taking that medicine.  But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually, and you might need to switch to another medicine instead.There are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help, but more studies are needed.The most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that, you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help, either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol.Both alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines, operations, and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure, you may need a liver transplant.What are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease?If you have any of the types of fatty liver disease, there are some lifestyle changes that can help:Eat a healthy diet, limiting salt and sugar, plus eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grainsGet vaccinations for hepatitis A and B, the flu and pneumococcal disease. If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver, it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections, so the other two vaccinations are also important.Get regular exercise, which can help you lose weight and reduce fat in the liverTalk with your doctor before using dietary supplements, such as vitamins, or any complementary or alternative medicines or medical practices. Some herbal remedies can damage your liver."}

{"id": "doc14", "contents": "Reflux in Children  What are reflux (GER) and GERD?The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. If your child has reflux, his or her stomach contents come back up into the esophagus. Another name for reflux is gastroesophageal reflux (GER).GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. If your child has reflux more than twice a week for a few weeks, it could be GERD.What causes reflux and GERD in children?There is a muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) that acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your child swallows, this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed, so the stomach contents don't flow back into the esophagus.In children who have reflux and GERD, this muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn't, and the stomach contents flow back into the esophagus. This can happen because of:A hiatal hernia, a condition in which the upper part of your stomach pushes upward into your chest through an opening in your diaphragmIncreased pressure on the abdomen from being overweight or having obesityMedicines, such as certain asthma medicines, antihistamines (which treat allergies), pain relievers, sedatives (which help put people to sleep), and antidepressantsSmoking or exposure to secondhand smokeA previous surgery on the esophagus or upper abdomenA severe developmental delayCertain neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsyHow common are reflux and GERD in children?Many children have occasional reflux. GERD is not as common; up to 25% of children have symptoms of GERD. What are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in children?Your child might not even notice reflux. But some children taste food or stomach acid at the back of the mouth. In children, GERD can cause:Heartburn, a painful, burning feeling in the middle of the chest. It is more common in older children (12 years and up).Bad breathNausea and vomitingProblems swallowing or painful swallowingBreathing problemsThe wearing away of teethHow do doctors diagnose reflux and GERD in children?In most cases, a doctor diagnoses reflux by reviewing your child's symptoms and medical history. If the symptoms do not get better with lifestyle changes and anti-reflux medicines, your child may need testing to check for GERD or other problems.Several tests can help a doctor diagnose GERD. Sometimes doctors order more than one test to get a diagnosis. Commonly-used tests include:Upper GI series, which looks at the shape of your child's upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract. You child will drink a contrast liquid called barium. For young children, the barium is mixed in with a bottle or other food. The health care professional will take several x-rays of your child to track the barium as it goes through the esophagus and stomach.Esophageal pH and impedance monitoring, which measures the amount of acid or liquid in your child's esophagus. A doctor or nurse places a thin flexible tube through your child's nose into the stomach. The end of the tube in the esophagus measures when and how much acid comes back up into the esophagus. The other end of the tube attaches to a monitor that records the measurements. Your child will wear the tube for 24 hours. He or she may need to stay in the hospital during the test.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy, which uses an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. The doctor runs the endoscope down your child's esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope, the doctor may also take tissue samples (biopsy).What lifestyle changes can help treat my child's reflux or GERD?Sometimes reflux and GERD in children can be treated with lifestyle changes:Losing weight, if neededEating smaller mealsAvoiding high-fat foodsWearing loose-fitting clothing around the abdomenStaying upright for 3 hours after meals and not reclining and slouching when sittingSleeping at a slight angle. Raise the head of your child's bed 6 to 8 inches by safely putting blocks under the bedposts.What treatments might the doctor give for my child's GERD?If changes at home do not help enough, the doctor may recommend medicines to treat GERD. The medicines work by lowering the amount of acid in your child's stomach.Some medicines for GERD in children are over-the-counter, and some are prescription medicines. They include:Over-the-counter antacidsH2 blockers, which decrease acid productionProton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which lower the amount of acid the stomach makesProkinetics, which help the stomach empty fasterIf these don't help and your child still has severe symptoms, then surgery might be an option. A pediatric gastroenterologist, a doctor who treats children who have digestive diseases, would do the surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"}

Along with the adenoids, tonsils are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance.  Tonsils and adenoids work by trapping the germs coming in through the mouth and nose.What is tonsillitis?Tonsillitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils. Sometimes along with tonsillitis, the adenoids are also swollen.What causes tonsillitis?The cause of tonsillitis is usually a viral infection. Bacterial infections such as strep throat can also cause tonsillitis.Who is at risk for tonsillitis?Tonsillitis is most common in children over age two. Almost every child in the United States gets it at least once. Tonsillitis caused by bacteria is more common in kids ages 5-15. Tonsillitis caused by a virus is more common in younger children.Adults can get tonsillitis, but it is not very common.Is tonsillitis contagious?Although tonsillitis is not contagious, the viruses and bacteria that cause it are contagious. Frequent handwashing can help prevent spreading or catching the infections.What are the symptoms of tonsillitis?The symptoms of tonsillitis include:A sore throat, which may be severeRed, swollen tonsilsTrouble swallowingA white or yellow coating on the tonsilsSwollen glands in the neckFeverBad breathWhen does my child need to see a health care provider for tonsillitis?You should call your health care provider if your child:Has a sore throat for more than two daysHas trouble or pain when swallowingFeels very sick or very weakYou should get emergency care right away if your child:Has trouble breathingStarts droolingHas a lot of trouble swallowingHow is tonsillitis diagnosed?To diagnose tonsillitis, your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes.Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep.What are the treatments for tonsillitis?Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take antibiotics. It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child.No matter what is causing the tonsillitis, there are some things you can do to help your child feel better. Make sure that your child:Gets a lot of restDrinks plenty of fluidsTries eating soft foods if it hurts to swallowTries eating warm liquids or cold foods like popsicles to soothe the throatIsn't around cigarette smoke or do anything else that could irritate the throatSleeps in a room with a humidifierGargles with saltwaterSucks on a lozenge (but do not give them to children under four; they can choke on them)Takes an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin.In some cases, your child may need a tonsillectomy.What is a tonsillectomy and why might my child need one?A tonsillectomy is surgery to remove the tonsils. Your child might need it if he or she:Keeps getting tonsillitisHas bacterial tonsillitis that does not get better with antibioticsHas tonsils are too big, and are causing trouble breathing or swallowingYour child usually gets the surgery and goes home later that day. Very young children and people who have complications may need to stay in the hospital overnight. It can take a week or two before your child completely recovers from the surgery."}

Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy, or stem cell transplantation.

They involve severe problems with your thoughts about food and your eating behaviors. You may eat much less or much more than you need.Eating disorders are medical conditions; they are not a lifestyle choice. They affect your body's ability to get proper nutrition. This can lead to health issues, such as heart and kidney problems, or sometimes even death. But there are treatments that can help.What are the types of eating disorders?Common types of eating disorders include:Binge-eating, which is out-of-control eating. People with binge-eating disorder keep eating even after they are full. They often eat until they feel very uncomfortable. Afterward, they usually have feelings of guilt, shame, and distress. Eating too much too often can lead to weight gain and obesity. Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S.Bulimia nervosa. People with bulimia nervosa also have periods of binge-eating. But afterwards, they purge, by making themselves throw up or using laxatives. They may also over-exercise or fast. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or overweight.Anorexia nervosa. People with anorexia nervosa avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They may see themselves as overweight, even when they are dangerously underweight. Anorexia nervosa is the least common of the three eating disorders, but it is often the most serious. It has the highest death rate of any mental disorder.What causes eating disorders?The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. Researchers believe that eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of factors. These include genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors.Who is at risk for eating disorders?Anyone can develop an eating disorder, but they are more common in women. Eating disorders frequently appear during the teen years or young adulthood. But people can also develop them during childhood or later in life.What are the symptoms of eating disorders?The symptoms of eating disorders vary, depending on the disorder:The symptoms of binge-eating include:Eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as a 2-hour periodEating even when you're full or not hungryEating fast during binge episodesEating until you're uncomfortably fullEating alone or in secret to avoid embarrassmentFeeling distressed, ashamed, or guilty about your eatingFrequently dieting, possibly without weight lossThe symptoms of bulimia nervosa include the same symptoms as binge-eating, plus trying to get rid of the food or weight after binging by:Purging, making yourself throw up or using laxatives or enemas to speed up the movement of food through your bodyDoing intensive and excessive exerciseFastingOver time, bulimia nervosa can cause health problems such as:Chronically inflamed and sore throatSwollen salivary glands in the neck and jaw areaWorn tooth enamel and increasingly sensitive and decaying teeth. This is caused by the exposure to stomach acid every time you throw up.GERD (acid reflux) and other gastrointestinal problemsSevere dehydration from purgingElectrolyte imbalance, which could be too low or too high levels of sodium, calcium, potassium and other minerals. This can lead to a stroke or heart attack.The symptoms of anorexia nervosa include:Eating very little, to the point of starving yourselfIntensive and excessive exerciseExtreme thinnessIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted body image - seeing yourself as overweight even when you are severely underweightOver time, anorexia nervosa can cause health problems such as:Thinning of the bones (osteopenia or osteoporosis)Mild anemiaMuscle wasting and weaknessThin, brittle hair and nailsDry, blotchy, or yellowish skinGrowth of fine hair all over the bodySevere constipationLow blood pressureSlowed breathing and pulseFeeling cold all the time because of a drop in internal body temperatureFeeling faint, dizzy, or weakFeeling tired all the timeInfertilityDamage to the structure and function of the heartBrain damageMultiorgan failureAnorexia nervosa can be fatal. Some people with this disorder die of complications from starvation, and others die of suicide.Some people with eating disorders may also have other mental disorders (such as depression or anxiety) or problems with substance use.How is eating disorders diagnosed?Because eating disorders can be so serious, it is important to seek help if you or a loved one thinks that you might have a problem. Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. It is important to be honest about your eating and exercise behaviors so your provider can help you.A physical examBlood or urine tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptomsOther tests to see whether you have any other health problems caused by the eating disorder. These can include kidney function tests and an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG).What are the treatments for eating disorders?Treatment plans for eating disorders are tailored to individual needs. You will likely have a team of providers helping you, including doctors, nutritionists, nurses, and therapists. The treatments may include:Individual, group, and/or family psychotherapy. Individual therapy may include cognitive behavioral approaches, which help you to identify and change negative and unhelpful thoughts.

{"id": "doc23", "contents": "Autoimmune Diseases  What are autoimmune diseases?Your immune system protects you from disease and infection by attacking germs that get into your body, such as viruses and bacteria. Your immune system can tell that the germs aren't part of you, so it destroys them. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake.There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. They can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the liver. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the pancreas.  And in rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, lungs, and eyes.What causes autoimmune diseases?No one is sure why autoimmune diseases happen. But you can't catch them from other people.Autoimmune diseases do tend to run in families, which means that certain genes may make some people more likely to develop a problem. Viruses, certain chemicals, and other things in the environment may trigger an autoimmune disease if you already have the genes for it.Who is at risk for autoimmune diseases?Millions of Americans of all ages have autoimmune diseases. Women develop many types of autoimmune diseases much more often than men. And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get another.What are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases?The symptoms of an autoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of autoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and symptoms of inflammation.  But other illnesses can cause the same symptoms.The symptoms of autoimmune diseases can come and go. During a flare-up, your symptoms may get severe for a while. Later on, you may have a remission, which means that your symptoms get better or disappear for a period of time.How are autoimmune diseases diagnosed?Doctors often have a hard time diagnosing autoimmune diseases. There's usually not a specific test to show whether you have a certain autoimmune disease. And the symptoms can be confusing. That's because many autoimmune diseases have similar symptoms. And some symptoms, such as muscle aches, are common in many other illnesses. So it can take a long time and some visits to different types of doctors to get a diagnosis.To help your doctor find out if an autoimmune disease is causing your symptoms,:Learn about the health conditions in your family history.  What health problems did your grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins have? Write down what you learn and share it with your doctor.Keep track of your symptoms, including how long they last and what makes them better or worse. Share your notes with your doctor.See a specialist who deals with the symptoms that bother you most. For example, if you have rash, see a dermatologist (skin doctor).What are the treatments for autoimmune diseases?The treatment depends on the disease. In most cases, the goal of treatment is to suppress (slow down) your immune system, and ease swelling, redness, and pain from inflammation. Your doctor may give you corticosteroids or other medicines to help you feel better. For some diseases, you may need treatment for the rest of your life."}

They include strong prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. Some opioids are made from the opium plant, and others are synthetic (man-made).A doctor may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer.  Some doctors prescribe them for chronic pain.Opioids can cause side effects such as drowsiness, mental fog, nausea, and constipation. They may also cause slowed breathing, which can lead to overdose deaths. If someone has signs of an overdose, call 911:The person's face is extremely pale and/or feels clammy to the touchTheir body goes limpTheir fingernails or lips have a purple or blue colorThey start vomiting or making gurgling noisesThey cannot be awakened or are unable to speakTheir breathing or heartbeat slows or stopsOther risks of using prescription opioids include dependence and addiction. Dependence means feeling withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes a person to compulsively seek out drugs, even though they cause harm. The risks of dependence and addiction are higher if you misuse the medicines. Misuse can include taking too much medicine, taking someone else's medicine, taking it in a different way than you are supposed to, or taking the medicine to get high.Opioid misuse, addiction, and overdoses are serious public health problems in the United States.  Another problem is that more women are misusing opioids during pregnancy. This can lead to babies being addicted and going through withdrawal, known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Opioid misuse may sometimes also lead to heroin use, because some people switch from prescription opioids to heroin.The main treatment for prescription opioid addiction is medication-assisted treatment (MAT). It includes medicines, counseling, and support from family and friends. MAT can help you stop using the drug, get through withdrawal, and cope with cravings. There is also a medicine called naloxone which can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and prevent death, if it is given in time.To prevent problems with prescription opioids, be sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking them. Do not share your medicines with anyone else. Contact your doctor if you have any concerns about taking the medicines.NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse"}

Addiction is a chronic brain disease. It causes you to compulsively seek out drugs even though they cause you harm.What are the treatments for opioid misuse and addiction?Treatments for opioid misuse and addiction include:MedicinesCounseling and behavioral therapiesMedication-assisted therapy (MAT), which includes medicines, counseling, and behavioral therapies. This offers a \"whole patient\" approach to treatment, which can increase your chance of a successful recovery.Residential and hospital-based treatmentWhich medicines treat opioid misuse and addiction?The medicines used to treat opioid misuse and addiction are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.Methadone and buprenorphine can decrease withdrawal symptoms and cravings. They work by acting on the same targets in the brain as other opioids, but they do not make you feel high. Some people worry that if they take methadone or buprenorphine, it means that they are substituting one addiction for another. But it is not; these medicines are a treatment. They restore balance to the parts of the brain affected by addiction. This allows your brain to heal while you work toward recovery.There is also a combination drug that includes buprenorphine and naloxone. Naloxone is a drug to treat an opioid overdose. If you take it along with buprenorphine, you will be less likely to misuse the buprenorphine.You may safely take these medicines for months, years, or even a lifetime. If you want to stop taking them, do not do it on your own. You should contact your health care provider first, and work out a plan for stopping.Naltrexone works differently than methadone and buprenorphine. It does not help you with withdrawal symptoms or cravings. Instead, it takes away the high that you would normally get when you take opioids. Because of this, you would take naltrexone to prevent a relapse, not to try to get off opioids. You have to be off opioids for at least 7-10 days before you can take naltrexone. Otherwise you could have bad withdrawal symptoms.How does counseling treat opioid misuse and addiction?Counseling for opioid misuse and addiction can help you:Change your attitudes and behaviors related to drug useBuild healthy life skillsStick with other forms of treatment, such as medicinesThere are different types of counseling to treat opioid misuse and addiction, including:Individual counseling, which may include setting goals, talking about setbacks, and celebrating progress. You may also talk about legal concerns and family problems. Counseling often includes specific behavioral therapies, such asCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you recognize and stop negative patterns of thinking and behavior. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and change the thoughts that cause you to want to misuse opioids.Motivational enhancement therapy helps you build up motivation to stick with your treatment planContingency management focuses on giving you incentives for positive behaviors such as staying off the opioidsGroup counseling, which can help you feel that you are not alone with your issues. You get a chance to hear about the difficulties and successes of others who have the same challenges. This can help you to learn new strategies for dealing with the situations you may come across.Family counseling/ includes partners or spouses and other family members who are close to you. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships.Counselors can also refer you to other resources that you might need, such as:Peer support groups, including 12-step programs like Narcotics AnonymousSpiritual and faith-based groupsHIV testing and hepatitis screeningCase or care managementEmployment or educational supportsOrganizations that help you find housing or transportationWhat are residential and hospital-based treatments for opioid misuse and addiction?Residential programs combine housing and treatment services. You are living with your peers, and you can support each other to stay in recovery. Inpatient hospital-based programs combine health care and addiction treatment services for people with medical problems. Hospitals may also offer intensive outpatient treatment. All these types of treatments are very structured, and usually include several different kinds of counseling and behavioral therapies. They also often include medicines."}

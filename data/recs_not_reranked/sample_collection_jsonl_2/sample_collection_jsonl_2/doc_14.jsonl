{"id": "doc2", "contents": "Pregnancy and Nutrition  What is nutrition, and why is it important during pregnancy?Nutrition is about eating a healthy and balanced diet so your body gets the nutrients that it needs. Nutrients are substances in foods that our bodies need so they can function and grow. They include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water.When you're pregnant, nutrition is more important than ever. You need more of many important nutrients than you did before pregnancy. Making healthy food choices every day will help you give your baby what he or she needs to develop. It will also help make sure that you and your baby gain the proper amount of weight.Do I have any special nutrition needs now that I am pregnant?You need more folic acid, iron, calcium, and vitamin D than you did before pregnancy:Folic acid is a B vitamin that may help prevent certain birth defects. Before pregnancy, you need 400 mcg (micrograms) per day. During pregnancy and when breastfeeding, you need 600 mcg per day from foods or vitamins. It is hard to get this amount from foods alone, so you need to take a supplement that contains folic acid.Iron is important for your baby's growth and brain development. During pregnancy, the amount of blood in your body increases, so you need more iron for yourself and your growing baby. You should get 27 mg (milligrams) of iron a day.Calcium during pregnancy can reduce your risk of preeclampsia, a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in blood pressure. Calcium also builds up your baby's bones and teeth.Pregnant adults should get 1,000 mg (milligrams) of calcium a dayPregnant teenagers (ages 14-18) need 1,300 mg of calcium a dayVitamin D helps the calcium to build up the baby's bones and teeth. All women, pregnant or not, should be getting 600 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day.Keep in mind that taking too much of a supplement can be harmful. For example, very high levels of vitamin A can cause birth defects. Only take vitamins and mineral supplements that your health care provider recommends.You also need more protein when you are pregnant. Healthy sources of protein include beans, peas, eggs, lean meats, seafood, and unsalted nuts and seeds.Hydration is another special nutritional concern during pregnancy. When you are pregnant, your body needs even more water to stay hydrated and support the life inside you. So it's important to drink enough fluids every day.How much weight should I gain during my pregnancy?How much weight you should gain depends on your health and how much you weighed before pregnancy:If you were at a normal weight before pregnancy, you should gain about 25 to 35 poundsIf you were underweight before pregnancy, you should gain moreIf you were overweight or had obesity before you become pregnant, you should gain lessCheck with your health care provider to find out how much weight gain during pregnancy is healthy for you. You should gain the weight gradually during your pregnancy, with most of the weight gained in the last trimester.Do I need to eat more calories when I am pregnant?How many calories you need depends on your weight gain goals. Your health care provider can tell you what your goal should be, based on things like your weight before pregnancy, your age, and how fast you gain weight. The general recommendations are:In the first trimester of pregnancy, you probably do not need extra caloriesIn the second trimester, you usually need about 340 extra caloriesIn the last trimester, you may need around 450 extra calories per dayDuring the final weeks of pregnancy, you may not need extra caloriesKeep in mind that not all calories are equal. You should eat healthy foods that are packed with nutrients - not \"empty calories\" such as those found in soft drinks, candies, and desserts.What foods should I avoid during pregnancy?During pregnancy, you should avoid:Alcohol. There is no known amount of alcohol that is safe for a woman to drink during pregnancy.Fish that may have high levels of mercury. Limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces per week. Do not eat tilefish, shark, swordfish, or king mackerel.Foods that are more likely to contain germs that could cause foodborne illness, including"}

They may occur 30 times or more an hour.The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways.  Children with enlarged tonsils or adenoids may also get it.Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment.

{"id": "doc5", "contents": "Adenoids  What are adenoids?Adenoids are a patch of tissue that is high up in the throat, just behind the nose. They, along with the tonsils, are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids and tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose.Adenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost completely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs.What are enlarged adenoids? Enlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in children.What causes enlarged adenoids?Your child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.What problems can enlarged adenoids cause?Enlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose.  Your child might end up breathing only through the mouth. This may cause:A dry mouth, which can also lead to bad breathCracked lipsA runny noseOther problems that enlarged adenoids can cause include:Loud breathingSnoringRestless sleepSleep apnea, a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing fduring sleepEar infectionsHow can enlarged adenoids be diagnosed?Your child's health care provider will take a medical history, check your child's ears, throat, and mouth, and feel your child's neck.Since the adenoids are higher up than the throat, the provider cannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth.  To check the size of your child's adenoids, your provider may use:A special mirror in the mouthA long, flexible tube with a light (an endoscope)An x-rayWhat are the treatments for enlarged adenoids?The treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are not too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may get nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a bacterial infection.In some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy.What is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one?An adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. The provider may recommend this surgery if:Your child has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear.Antibiotics can't get rid of a bacterial infection of the adenoids.The enlarged adenoids block the airways.If there is also a problem with the tonsils, your child will probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that the adenoids are removed.After having the surgery, your child usually goes home the same day. Your child will probably have some throat pain, bad breath, and a runny nose. It can take several days to feel all better."}
{"id": "doc6", "contents": "Oxygen Therapy  What is oxygen?Oxygen is a gas that your body needs to work properly. Your cells need oxygen to make energy. Your lungs absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. The oxygen enters your blood from your lungs and travels to your organs and body tissues.Certain medical conditions can cause your blood oxygen levels to be too low. Low blood oxygen may make you feel short of breath, tired, or confused. It can also damage your body. Oxygen therapy can help you get more oxygen.What is oxygen therapy?Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen to breathe in. It is also called supplemental oxygen. It is only available through a prescription from your health care provider. You may get it in the hospital, another medical setting, or at home. Some people only need it for a short period of time. Others will need long-term oxygen therapy.There are different types of devices that can give you oxygen. Some use tanks of liquid or gas oxygen. Others use an oxygen concentrator, which pulls oxygen out of the air. You will get the oxygen through a nose tube (cannula), a mask, or a tent. The extra oxygen is breathed in along with normal air.There are portable versions of the tanks and oxygen concentrators. They can make it easier for you to move around while using your therapy.Who needs oxygen therapy?You may need oxygen therapy if you have a condition that causes low blood oxygen, such as:COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)PneumoniaCOVID-19A severe asthma attackLate-stage heart failureCystic fibrosisSleep apneaWhat are the risks of using oxygen therapy?Oxygen therapy is generally safe, but it can cause side effects. They include a dry or bloody nose, tiredness, and morning headaches.Oxygen poses a fire risk, so you should never smoke or use flammable materials when using oxygen. If you use oxygen tanks, make sure your tank is secured and stays upright. If it falls and cracks or the top breaks off, the tank can fly like a missile.What is hyperbaric oxygen therapy?Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a different type of oxygen therapy. It involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber or tube. This allows your lungs to gather up to three times more oxygen than you would get by breathing oxygen at normal air pressure. The extra oxygen moves through your blood and to your organs and body tissues. HBOT is used to treat certain serious wounds, burns, injuries, and infections. It also treats air or gas embolisms (bubbles of air in your bloodstream), decompression sickness suffered by divers, and carbon monoxide poisoning.But some treatment centers claim that HBOT can treat almost anything, including HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, autism, and cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not cleared or approved the use of HBOT for these conditions. There are risks to using HBOT, so always check with your primary health care provider before you try it.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}

{"id": "doc9", "contents": "Diabetic Eye Problems  What is diabetes?Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.What eye problems can diabetes cause?Over time, high blood sugar may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetes eye problems include:Diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment, where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye.Diabetic macular edema (DME), which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (a part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy.Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye.Cataract, which happen when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes.Who is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems?Anyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. But your risk of developing it is higher if you:Have had diabetes for a long timeDon't have good control over your high blood sugar or high blood pressureAre pregnantHave high blood cholesterolSmoke tobaccoWhat are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems?In the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilated eye exams are so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy.You should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could mean an emergency. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms:Many new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters)Flashes of lightA dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtainVision lossEye pain or rednessTalk with your doctor if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go:Spots or dark wavy strings floating in your visionBlurry or wavy visionVision that changes a lotTrouble seeing colorsHow are diabetic eye problems diagnosed?Eye doctors do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems.

On the other hand, dementia develops slowly and does not cause hallucinations. The symptoms are stable and may last for months or years.What are the treatments for delirium?Treatment of delirium focuses on the causes and symptoms of delirium. The first step is to identify the cause. Often, treating the cause will lead to a full recovery. The recovery may take some time - weeks or sometimes even months. In the meantime, there may be treatments to manage the symptoms, such as:Controlling the environment, which includes making sure that the room is quiet and well-lit, having clocks or calendars in view, and having family members aroundMedicines, including those that control aggression or agitation and pain relievers if there is painIf needed, making sure that the person has a hearing aid, glasses, or other devices for communicationCan delirium be prevented?Treating the conditions that can cause delirium may reduce the risk of getting it.

In serious cases, the coughing can become violent and rapid. You may cough so hard that you vomit. The name of the disease comes from the whooping noise you might make when you try to breathe in after coughing.Whooping cough is very contagious and can affect anyone. But it can be especially serious in babies who did not yet get the vaccine. About half of babies under age one who get whooping cough need care in the hospital.What causes whooping cough?Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. It spreads from person to person. People who have pertussis usually spread it through coughing, sneezing, or breathing very close to someone. It can also sometimes be spread by touching an infected surface and then touching your nose or mouth.If you get pertussis, you are contagious for about 2 weeks after you start coughing. Antibiotics may shorten the time that you are contagious.What are the symptoms of whooping cough?The symptoms of pertussis usually start within 5 to 10 days after you are exposed. But sometimes you may not get symptoms until up to 3 weeks later.Whooping cough usually starts with cold-like symptoms. They may last for 1 to 2 weeks and can include:Runny noseMild feverMild, occasional coughThe early symptoms in babies can be different. They may only cough a little bit, or they may not cough at all. Babies may have apnea, which means that there is a pause in breathing. They may start to turn blue. If this happens, get medical care for your baby right away.As whopping cough gets worse, the symptoms may include:Fits of many, rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" soundVomiting during or after coughing fitsExhaustion after coughing fits"}

But other head injuries can be more severe, such as a skull fracture, concussion, or traumatic brain injury.Head injuries can be open or closed.  A closed injury does not break through the skull.  With an open, or penetrating, injury, an object pierces the skull and enters the brain.  Closed injuries are not always less severe than open injuries.Some common causes of head injuries are falls, motor vehicle accidents, violence, and sports injuries.It is important to know the warning signs of a moderate or severe head injury.

{"id": "doc24", "contents": "Drug Reactions  Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions, such as drug interactions, side effects, and allergies.What is a drug interaction?A drug interaction is a change in the way a drug acts in the body when taken with certain other drugs, foods, or supplements or when taken while you have certain medical conditions. Examples include:Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinnersDrugs and food, such as statins and grapefruitDrugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinnersDrugs and medical conditions, such as aspirin and peptic ulcersInteractions could cause a drug to be more or less effective, cause side effects, or change the way one or both drugs work.What are side effects?Side effects are unwanted, usually unpleasant, effects caused by medicines. Most are mild, such as a stomachache, dry mouth, or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the medicine.  Others can be more serious. Sometimes a drug can interact with a disease that you have and cause a side effect. For example, if you have a heart condition, certain decongestants can cause you to have a rapid heartbeat.What are drug allergies?Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can range from mild to life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is less common.How can I stay safe when taking medicines?When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medicine, make sure you understand how to take it correctly.

It happens when a hit to the head or body causes your head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, creating chemical changes in your brain. Sometimes it can also stretch and damage your brain cells.Sometimes people call a concussion a \"mild\" brain injury. It is important to understand that while concussions may not be life-threatening, they can still be serious.Concussions are a common type of sports injury. Other causes of concussions include blows to the head, bumping your head when you fall, being violently shaken, and car accidents.Symptoms of a concussion may not start right away; they may start days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea, ringing in your ears, dizziness, or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury.

You will most likely have a neurological exam, which checks your vision, balance, coordination, and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases, you may also have a scan of the brain, such as a CT scan or an MRI. A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain, as well as a skull fracture (break in the skull).Most people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning, you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration, such as studying, working on the computer, or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse. Then when your health care provider says that it is ok, you can start to return to your normal activities slowly.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}

Your spine has joints, too.But joints are more than bones. They include the soft tissues around them, such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments. Cartilage is the hard slippery flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. Tendons are tough, flexible bands that connect your muscles to your bones so you can move your joints. Ligaments connect the bones of the joint to each other to keep them stable when you move.What are joint disorders?Joint disorders are diseases or injuries that affect your joints. Injuries can happen because of overuse of a joint. Or you could have a sudden injury, such as an accident or a sports injury.What diseases can affect the joints?Many diseases can affect the joints. They often cause joint pain and make your joints stiff, red, or swollen. Most of them are chronic. That means they last a long time. Some may never go away completely. Some of the diseases that affect the joints include:Arthritis. Arthritis may cause joint pain and swelling. There are many types of this disease. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. Over time, arthritis can cause severe joint damage. It can affect people of all ages. A joint injury when you're young may cause osteoarthritis later in life.Lupus. This autoimmune disease affects many parts of the body and can cause joint and muscle pain. Some types of lupus often cause arthritis.Sjögren's Syndrome. This autoimmune disease affects glands that make moisture in many parts of the body. The main symptoms are dry eyes and mouth, but it often causes joint pain, too.Treatments are different depending on the disease. But most treatments include medicines and therapies to relieve pain and other symptoms.What types of joint disorders happen from sudden injuries?Joint disorders from sudden injuries include:Sprains and strains. Sprains are stretched or torn ligaments. Acute strains are stretched or torn muscles or tendons that happen from a sudden injury or movement, such as lifting a heavy object.Dislocated joints. A joint is dislocated when the bones are pushed or pulled out of position. A joint dislocation is a medical emergency.Treatment depends on the type of injury. You can treat many sports injuries at home. But you should call your health care provider if you:Have a lot of joint pain, swelling or numbnessCan't put weight on the jointHave pain from an old injury with more swelling, an unstable joint, or a joint that isn't normal in another wayWhat types of joint disorders happen from overuse?Overuse injuries usually damage the soft tissues of the joint. They can happen when you work a joint too hard by doing the same movements over and over. For example, you could get an overuse injury from playing a musical instrument, playing sports, or doing certain jobs, such as carpentry or painting.Joint overuse injuries include:Bursitis. The bursa is a small fluid-filled sac. It works as a pad between the bones of a joint and the moving parts around it, such as muscles, tendons and skin. With bursitis, the bursa becomes irritated and swollen with extra fluid. Overuse is the most common cause, but injuries, infections and other conditions, such as arthritis, can cause bursitis.Tendinitis. This condition happens when you overuse a tendon. It swells and makes the joint painful to move.Chronic strain. A strain becomes chronic when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear slowly over time from repeating the same movements.The treatments for bursitis, tendinitis, and chronic strain are often the same. They usually include rest, keeping the injured joint higher than your heart, and taking medicine to reduce swelling. Your provider may recommend gentle exercise and other treatment. In some cases, your provider may suggest an injection (a shot) of medicine into the joint. If these do not help, you may need surgery.How can I keep my joints healthy?Getting enough physical activity is one of the most important things you can do to prevent or slow joint disorders. Activity strengthens the muscles around your joints and helps them work better.When you play sports, wear the right equipment to protect your joints, such as knee pads. If you already have joint problems, ask your provider what type of activities are best for you.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"}

When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems:The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elasticThe walls between many of the air sacs are destroyedThe walls of the airways become thick and inflamedThe airways make more mucus than usual and can become cloggedWhat are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?COPD includes two main types:Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic.Chronic bronchitis, in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus.Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.What causes COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?The cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them.Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD.

{"id": "doc42", "contents": "Emphysema  What is emphysema?Emphysema is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is chronic bronchitis. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out.In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs in the lungs are damaged. This causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become floppy. The damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This makes it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.What causes emphysema?The cause of emphysema is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and the airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause emphysema, especially if you inhale them.Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to emphysema. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing emphysema.Who is at risk for emphysema?The risk factors for emphysema include:Smoking.

It may help to strengthen connections to a loved one. You may feel fulfillment from helping someone else. But sometimes caregiving can be stressful and even overwhelming. This can be especially true when caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease (AD).AD is an illness that changes the brain. It causes people to lose the ability to remember, think, and use good judgment. They also have trouble taking care of themselves. Over time, as the disease gets worse, they will need more and more help. As a caregiver, it is important for you to learn about AD. You will want to know what happens to the person during the different stages of the disease. This can help you plan for the future, so that you will have all of the resources you will need to be able to take care of your loved one.As a caregiver for someone with AD, your responsibilities can include:Getting your loved one's health, legal, and financial affairs in order. If possible, include them in the planning while they can still make decisions. Later you will need to take over managing their finances and paying their bills."}
{"id": "doc45", "contents": "Alzheimer's Disease  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people. Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person's ability to carry out daily activities. AD begins slowly. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language. People with AD may have trouble remembering things that happened recently or names of people they know. A related problem, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age.  Many, but not all, people with MCI will develop AD.In AD, over time, symptoms get worse. People may not recognize family members. They may have trouble speaking, reading or writing. They may forget how to brush their teeth or comb their hair. Later on, they may become anxious or aggressive, or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them.AD usually begins after age 60.  The risk goes up as you get older. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease. No treatment can stop the disease. However, some drugs may help keep symptoms from getting worse for a limited time.NIH: National Institute on Aging"}
{"id": "doc46", "contents": "Rh Incompatibility  There are four major blood types: A, B, O, and AB. The types are based on substances on the surface of the blood cells. Another blood type is called Rh. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells.  Most people are Rh-positive; they have Rh factor.  Rh-negative people don't have it.  Rh factor is inherited through genes.When you're pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance.  It will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy.But Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies, if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed.  The antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells.  The baby could get Rh disease, a serious condition that can cause a serious type of anemia.Blood tests can tell whether you have Rh factor and whether your body has made antibodies. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility.  If treatment is needed for the baby, it can include supplements to help the body to make red blood cells and blood transfusions.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}

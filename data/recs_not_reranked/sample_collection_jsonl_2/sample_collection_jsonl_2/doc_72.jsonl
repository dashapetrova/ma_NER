Your lymph system is part of your immune system. It helps protect your body from infection and disease.The lymph system is made up of tissues and organs that produce, store, and carry white blood cells. It includes your:Bone marrowLymph nodesLymphatic vesselsSpleenThymusTonsilsHodgkin lymphoma is one of the main types of lymphoma. The other is non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Each type starts in different types of white blood cells.What causes Hodgkin lymphoma?The cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. But there are certain people who are at higher risk of developing it.Who is more likely to develop Hodgkin lymphoma?Certain factors can make you more likely to develop Hodgkin lymphoma:Age. Hodgkin lymphoma is most common in early adulthood (age 20-39 years) and in late adulthood (age 65 years and older).Being male. The risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma is slightly higher in males than in females.Past Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Having an infection with EBV as a young child or teenager increases your risk of Hodgkin lymphoma.A family history of Hodgkin lymphoma. Having a parent or sibling with Hodgkin lymphoma increases your risk of developing it.What are the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma?The signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma may include:Painless, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, or groinFever for no known reasonDrenching night sweats (very heavy sweating during sleep)Weight loss for no known reason in the past 6 monthsItchy skin, especially after bathing or drinking alcoholFatigueHow is Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed?To find out if you have Hodgkin lymphoma, your provider:Will ask about your symptoms and medical history.

It affects an area of the spinal cord called gray matter. This can cause the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak.Because of these symptoms, some people call AFM a \"polio-like\" illness. But since 2014, people with AFM have been tested, and they did not have poliovirus.What causes acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Researchers think that viruses, including enteroviruses, likely play a role in causing AFM.  Most people with AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever (like you would get from a viral infection) before they got AFM.Who is at risk for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Anyone can get AFM, but most cases (more than 90%) have been in young children.What are the symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Most people with AFM will suddenly have:Arm or leg weaknessA loss of muscle tone and reflexesSome people also have other symptoms, including:Facial drooping/weaknessTrouble moving the eyesDrooping eyelidsTrouble swallowingSlurred speechPain in the arms, legs, back, or neckSometimes AFM can weaken the muscles that you need for breathing. This can lead to respiratory failure, which is very serious. If you get respiratory failure, you may need to use a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe.If you or your child develops any of these symptoms, you should get medical care right away.How is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) diagnosed?AFM causes many of the same symptoms as other neurologic diseases, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. This can make it difficult to diagnose. The doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A neurologic exam, including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexesAn MRI to look at the spinal cord and brainLab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord)Nerve conduction and electromyography (EMG) studies. These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start.What are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?There is no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms. For example, physical and/or occupational therapy may help with arm or leg weakness. Researchers do not know the long-term outcomes of people with AFM.Can acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) be prevented?Since viruses likley play a role in AFM, you should take steps to help prevent getting or spreading viral infections by:Washing hands often with soap and waterAvoiding touching your face with unwashed handsAvoiding close contact with people who are sickCleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toysCovering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not handsStaying home when sickCenters for Disease Control and Prevention"}

Two specific kinds are polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Polymyositis causes muscle weakness, usually in the muscles closest to the trunk of your body. Dermatomyositis causes muscle weakness, plus a skin rash.Other symptoms of myositis may include:Fatigue after walking or standingTripping or fallingTrouble swallowing or breathingDoctors may use a physical exam, lab tests, imaging tests and a muscle biopsy to diagnose myositis. There is no cure for these diseases, but you can treat the symptoms. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are first treated with high doses of a corticosteroid.

For example, you may have weakness in the muscles for eye movement, facial expressions, and swallowing. You can also have weakness in other muscles.  This weakness gets worse with activity, and better with rest.Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease. Your body's immune system makes antibodies that block or change some of the nerve signals to your muscles.  This makes your muscles weaker.Other conditions can cause muscle weakness, so myasthenia gravis can be hard to diagnose. Tests used to make a diagnosis include blood, nerve, muscle, and imaging tests.With treatment, the muscle weakness often gets much better. Medicines can help improve nerve-to-muscle messages and make muscles stronger. Other drugs keep your body from making so many abnormal antibodies. These medicines can have major side effects, so they should be used carefully. There are also treatments which filter abnormal antibodies from the blood or add healthy antibodies from donated blood. Sometimes, surgery to take out the thymus gland helps.Some people with myasthenia gravis go into remission. This means that they do not have symptoms.

It can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to other diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will take your medical history and do physical and neurological exams. You may have an MRI or other imaging tests.What are the treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)?There is currently no effective treatment for PSP. Medicines may reduce some symptoms. Some non-drug treatments, such as walking aids and special glasses, may also help. People with severe swallowing problems may need gastrostomy. This is a surgery to insert a feeding tube into the stomach.PSP gets worse over time. Many people become severely disabled within three to five years after getting it. PSP isn't life-threatening on its own. It can still be be dangerous, because it increases your risk of pneumonia, choking from swallowing problems, and injuries from falling.

Most birth defects happen during the first 3 months of pregnancy. One out of every 33 babies in the United States is born with a birth defect.A birth defect may affect how the body looks, works, or both. Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, like heart disease, are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. How a birth defect affects a child's life depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved and how severe the defect is.What causes birth defects?For some birth defects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors, which can include:Genetics. One or more genes might have a change or mutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile X syndrome. With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing.Chromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might be missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome. In other cases, such as with Down syndrome, the child has an extra chromosome. Exposures to medicines, chemicals, or other toxic substances. For example, alcohol misuse can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.Infections during pregnancy. For example, infection with Zika virus during pregnancy can cause a serious defect in the brain.Lack of certain nutrients. Not getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy is a key factor in causing neural tube defects.Who is at risk of having a baby with birth defects?Certain factors may might increase the chances of having a baby with a birth defect, such as:Smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking certain \"street\" drugs during pregnancyHaving certain medical conditions, such as obesity or uncontrolled diabetes, before and during pregnancyTaking certain medicinesHaving someone in your family with a birth defect. To learn more about your risk of having a baby with a birth defect, you can talk with a genetic counselor,Being an older mother, typically over the age of 34 yearsHow are birth defects diagnosed?Health care providers can diagnose some birth defects during pregnancy, using prenatal testing.  That's why it important to get regular prenatal care.Other birth defects may not be found until after the baby is born. Providers may find them through newborn screening. Some defects, such as club foot, are obvious right away. Other times, the health care provider may not discover a defect until later in life, when the child has symptoms.What are the treatments for birth defects?Children with birth defects often need special care and treatments. Because the symptoms and problems caused by birth defects vary, the treatments also vary. Possible treatments may include surgery, medicines, assistive devices, physical therapy, and speech therapy.Often, children with birth defects need a variety of services and may need to see several specialists. The primary health care provider can coordinate the special care that the child needs.Can birth defects be prevented?Not all birth defects can be prevented.

It is a common condition. It can range from being a minor problem to something that greatly affects your daily life.  In any case, it can get better with proper treatment.What are the types of urinary incontinence (UI)?There are several different types of UI. Each type has different symptoms and causes:Stress incontinence happens when stress or pressure on your bladder causes you to leak urine.  This could be due to coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, or physical activity. Causes include weak pelvic floor muscles and the bladder being out of its normal position.Urge, or urgency, incontinence happens when you have a strong urge (need) to urinate, and some urine leaks out before you can make it to the toilet. It is often related to an overactive bladder. Urge incontinence is most common in older people. It can sometimes be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It can also happen in some neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries.Overflow incontinence happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. This causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. Your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. This form of UI is most common in men. Some of the causes include tumors, kidney stones, diabetes, and certain medicines.Functional incontinence happens when a physical or mental disability, trouble speaking, or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. For example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with Alzheimer's disease may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet.Mixed incontinence means that you have more than one type of incontinence. It's usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence.Transient incontinence is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine.

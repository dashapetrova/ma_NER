{"id": "doc3", "contents": "Hidradenitis Suppurativa  What is hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)?Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease. It causes painful, boil-like lumps that form under the skin. It often affects areas where the skin rubs together, such as your armpits and groin. The lumps become inflamed and painful. They often break open, causing abscesses that drain fluid and pus. As the abscesses heal, they can cause scarring of the skin.What causes hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)?The lumps in HS form because of blockages of the hair follicles. The blocked hair follicles trap bacteria, which leads to inflammation and rupture. In most cases, the cause of the blockages is unknown. Genetics, environment, and hormonal factors may play a role. Some cases of HS are caused by changes in certain genes.HS is not caused by bad hygiene, and it cannot be spread to others.Who is at risk for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)?HS usually starts after puberty, usually in the teens or twenties. It is more common in:WomenPeople with a family history of HSPeople who are overweight or have obesitySmokersWhat are the symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)?The symptoms of HS include:Small pitted areas of skin containing blackheadsPainful, red, lumps that get bigger and break open. This causes abscesses that drain fluid and pus. They may itch and have an unpleasant odor.The abscesses heal very slowly, recur over time, and can lead to scarring and tunnels under the skinHS can be mild, moderate, or severe:In mild HS, there are only one or a few lumps in one area of the skin. A mild case will often get worse, becoming a moderate disease.Moderate HS include recurrences of the lumps that get bigger and break open. The lumps form in more than one area of the body.With severe HS, there are widespread lumps, scarring, and chronic pain that may make it hard to moveBecause of the difficulty of dealing with the disease, people with HS are at risk for depression and anxiety.How is hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) diagnosed?There is no specific test for HS, and it is often misdiagnosed in the early stages. To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will ask about your medical history and your symptoms. He or she will look at the lumps on your skin and test a sample of the skin or pus (if there is any).What are the treatments for hidradenitis suppurativa?There is no cure for HS. Treatments focus on the symptoms, but they are not always effective for everyone. The treatments depend on how severe the disease is, and they include:Medicines, including steroids, antibiotics, pain relievers, and medicines that flight inflammation. In mild cases, the medicines may be topical. This means that you apply them to your skin. Otherwise the medicines may be injected or taken orally (by mouth).Surgery for severe cases, to remove the lumps and scarsIt may also help if you can avoid things that can irritate your skin, by:Wearing loose-fitting clothingStaying at a healthy weightQuitting smokingAvoiding heat and humidityBeing careful not to injure your skin"}

{"id": "doc8", "contents": "Primary Ovarian Insufficiency  What is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure, happens when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40.Many women naturally experience reduced fertility when they are about 40 years old. They may start getting irregular menstrual periods as they transition to menopause. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility start before the age of 40. Sometimes it can start as early as the teenage years.POI is different from premature menopause. With premature menopause, your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. With POI, some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant.  In most cases of POI, the cause is unknown.What causes primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?In about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is unknown.Research shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles. Follicles are small sacs in your ovaries. Your eggs grow and mature inside them. One type of follicle problem is that you run out of working follicles earlier than normal. Another is that the follicles are not working properly. In most cases, the cause of the follicle problem is unknown. But sometimes the cause may be:Genetic disorders such as Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndromeA low number of folliclesAutoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis and Addison diseaseChemotherapy or radiation therapyMetabolic disordersToxins, such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, and pesticidesWho is at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?Certain factors can raise a woman's risk of POI:Family history. Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have it.Genes. Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. For example, women Fragile X syndrome or Turner syndrome are at higher risk.Certain diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and viral infectionsCancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapyAge. Younger women can get POI, but it becomes more common between the ages of 35-40.What are the symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?The first sign of POI is usually irregular or missed periods. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause:Hot flashesNight sweatsIrritabilityPoor concentrationDecreased sex drivePain during sexVaginal drynessFor many women with POI, trouble getting pregnant or infertility is the reason they go to their health care provider.What other problems can primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) cause?Since POI causes you to have lower levels of certain hormones, you are at greater risk for other health conditions, including:Anxiety and depression. Hormonal changes caused by POI can contribute to anxiety or lead to depression.Dry eye syndrome and eye surface disease. Some women with POI have one of these eye conditions. Both can cause discomfort and may lead to blurred vision. If not treated, these conditions can cause permanent eye damage.Heart disease. Lower levels of estrogen can affect the muscles lining the arteries and can increase the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. These factors increase your risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).Infertility.Low thyroid function. This problem also is called hypothyroidism. The thyroid is a gland that makes hormones that control your body's metabolism and energy level. Low levels thyroid hormones can affect your metabolism and can cause very low energy, mental sluggishness, and other symptoms.Osteoporosis. The hormone estrogen helps keep bones strong. Without enough estrogen, women with POI often develop osteoporosis. It is a bone disease that causes weak, brittle bones that are more likely to break.How is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnosed?To diagnose POI, your health care provider may do:A medical history, including asking whether you have relatives with POIA pregnancy test, to make sure that you are not pregnantA physical exam, to look for signs of other disorders which could be causing your symptomsBlood tests, to check for certain hormone levels. You may also have a blood test to do a chromosome analysis. A chromosome is the part of a cell that contains genetic information.A pelvic ultrasound, to see whether or not the ovaries are enlarged or have multiple folliclesHow is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) treated?Currently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries.  But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI. There are also ways to lower your health risks and treat the conditions that POI can cause:Hormone replacement therapy (HRT).HRT is the most common treatment. It gives your body the estrogen and other hormones that your ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual health and decreases the risks for heart disease and osteoporosis. You usually take it until about age 50; that's about the age when menopause usually begins.Calcium and vitamin D supplements. Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, you should take calcium and vitamin D every day.In vitro fertilization (IVF). If you have POI and you wish to become pregnant, you may consider trying IVF.Regular physical activity and a healthy body weight.Getting regular exercise and controlling your weight can lower your risk for osteoporosis and heart disease.Treatments for associated conditions. If you have a condition that is related to POI, it is important to treat that as well. Treatments may involve medicines and hormones.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"}

{"id": "doc29", "contents": "Concussion  A concussion is a type of brain injury.  It involves a short loss of normal brain function. It happens when a hit to the head or body causes your head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, creating chemical changes in your brain. Sometimes it can also stretch and damage your brain cells.Sometimes people call a concussion a \"mild\" brain injury. It is important to understand that while concussions may not be life-threatening, they can still be serious.Concussions are a common type of sports injury. Other causes of concussions include blows to the head, bumping your head when you fall, being violently shaken, and car accidents.Symptoms of a concussion may not start right away; they may start days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea, ringing in your ears, dizziness, or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury. Consult your health care professional if any of your symptoms get worse, or if you have more serious symptoms such as:Convulsions or seizuresDrowsiness or inability to wake upA headache that gets worse and does not go awayWeakness, numbness, or decreased coordinationRepeated vomiting or nauseaConfusionSlurred speechLoss of consciousnessTo diagnose a concussion, your health care provider will do a physical exam and will ask about your injury. You will most likely have a neurological exam, which checks your vision, balance, coordination, and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases, you may also have a scan of the brain, such as a CT scan or an MRI. A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain, as well as a skull fracture (break in the skull).Most people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning, you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration, such as studying, working on the computer, or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse. Then when your health care provider says that it is ok, you can start to return to your normal activities slowly.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}

{"id": "doc32", "contents": "Growth Disorders  Does your child seem much shorter - or much taller - than other kids his or her age? It could be normal. Some children may be small for their age but still be developing normally. Some children are short or tall because their parents are.But some children have growth disorders.  Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height, weight, sexual maturity or other features.Very slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease.The pituitary gland makes growth hormone, which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth.People can also have too much growth hormone.  Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor, which is not cancer.  Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children, where their bones and their body grow too much.  In adults, it can cause acromegaly, which makes the hands, feet and face larger than normal. Possible treatments include surgery to remove the tumor, medicines, and radiation therapy."}
{"id": "doc33", "contents": "Pituitary Disorders  Your pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain. The pituitary is the \"master control gland\" - it makes hormones that affect growth and the functions of other glands in the body. With pituitary disorders, you often have too much or too little of one of your hormones.  Injuries can cause pituitary disorders, but the most common cause is a pituitary tumor."}
{"id": "doc34", "contents": "Sweat  Sweat is a clear, salty liquid produced by glands in your skin. Sweating is how your body cools itself. You sweat mainly under your arms and on your feet and palms. When sweat mixes with bacteria on your skin, it can cause a smell. Bathing regularly and using antiperspirants or deodorants can help control the odor. Sweating a lot is normal when it is hot or when you exercise, are anxious, or have a fever. It also happens during menopause. If you often sweat too much, it's called hyperhidrosis. Causes include thyroid or nervous system disorders, low blood sugar, or another health problem. Sweating too little, anhidrosis, can be life-threatening because your body can overheat. Causes of anhidrosis include dehydration, burns, and some skin and nerve disorders.  "}

Without quick treatment, it can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and even death.What causes sepsis?Sepsis happens when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. Bacterial infections are the most common cause, but other types of infections can also cause it.The infections are often in the lungs, stomach, kidneys, or bladder. It's possible for sepsis to begin with a small cut that gets infected or with an infection that develops after surgery. Sometimes, sepsis can occur in people who didn't even know that they had an infection.Who is at risk for sepsis?Anyone with an infection could get sepsis. But certain people are at higher risk:Adults 65 or olderPeople with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease, cancer, and kidney diseasePeople with weakened immune systemsPregnant womenChildren younger than oneWhat are the symptoms of sepsis?Sepsis can cause one or more of these symptoms:Rapid breathing and heart rateShortness of breathConfusion or disorientationExtreme pain or discomfortFever, shivering, or feeling very coldClammy or sweaty skinIt's important to get medical care right away if you think you might have sepsis or if your infection is not getting better or is getting worse.What other problems can sepsis cause?Severe cases of sepsis can lead to septic shock, where your blood pressure drops to a dangerous level and multiple organs can fail.How is sepsis diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam, including checking vital signs (your temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing)Lab tests that check for signs of infection or organ damageImaging tests such as an x-ray or a CT scan to find the location of the infectionMany of the signs and symptoms of sepsis can also be caused by other medical conditions. This may make sepsis hard to diagnose in its early stages.What are the treatments for sepsis?It is very important to get treatment right away. Treatment usually includes:AntibioticsMaintaining blood flow to organs. This may involve getting oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids.Treating the source of the infectionIf needed, medicines to increase blood pressureIn serious cases, you might need kidney dialysis or a breathing tube. Some people need surgery to remove tissue damaged by the infection.Can sepsis be prevented?To prevent sepsis, you should try to prevent getting an infection:Take good care of any chronic health conditions that you haveGet recommended vaccinesPractice good hygiene, such as handwashingKeep cuts clean and covered until healedNIH: National Institute of General Medical SciencesCenters for Disease Control and Prevention"}

It affects an area of the spinal cord called gray matter. This can cause the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak.Because of these symptoms, some people call AFM a \"polio-like\" illness. But since 2014, people with AFM have been tested, and they did not have poliovirus.What causes acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Researchers think that viruses, including enteroviruses, likely play a role in causing AFM.  Most people with AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever (like you would get from a viral infection) before they got AFM.Who is at risk for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Anyone can get AFM, but most cases (more than 90%) have been in young children.What are the symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Most people with AFM will suddenly have:Arm or leg weaknessA loss of muscle tone and reflexesSome people also have other symptoms, including:Facial drooping/weaknessTrouble moving the eyesDrooping eyelidsTrouble swallowingSlurred speechPain in the arms, legs, back, or neckSometimes AFM can weaken the muscles that you need for breathing. This can lead to respiratory failure, which is very serious. If you get respiratory failure, you may need to use a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe.If you or your child develops any of these symptoms, you should get medical care right away.How is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) diagnosed?AFM causes many of the same symptoms as other neurologic diseases, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. This can make it difficult to diagnose. The doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A neurologic exam, including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexesAn MRI to look at the spinal cord and brainLab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord)Nerve conduction and electromyography (EMG) studies. These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start.What are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?There is no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms. For example, physical and/or occupational therapy may help with arm or leg weakness. Researchers do not know the long-term outcomes of people with AFM.Can acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) be prevented?Since viruses likley play a role in AFM, you should take steps to help prevent getting or spreading viral infections by:Washing hands often with soap and waterAvoiding touching your face with unwashed handsAvoiding close contact with people who are sickCleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toysCovering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not handsStaying home when sickCenters for Disease Control and Prevention"}

Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including:Streptococcus pneumoniaeLegionella pneumophila; this pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' diseaseMycoplasma pneumoniaeChlamydia pneumoniaeHaemophilus influenzaeViruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia.

{"id": "doc14", "contents": "Sickle Cell Disease  What is sickle cell disease (SCD)?Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. If you have SCD, there is a problem with your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood cells. This changes the shape of the red blood cells. The cells are supposed to be disc-shaped, but this changes them into a crescent, or sickle, shape.The sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The sickle cells usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new cells to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood cells. This is a condition called anemia, and it can make you feel tired.The sickle-shaped cells can also stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen can't reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These attacks can occur without warning. If you get one, you might need to go to the hospital for treatment.What causes sickle cell disease (SCD)?The cause of SCD is a defective gene, called a sickle cell gene. People with the disease are born with two sickle cell genes, one from each parent.If you are born with one sickle cell gene, it's called sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy, but they can pass the defective gene on to their children.Who is at risk for sickle cell disease (SCD)?In the United States, most of the people with SCD are African Americans:About 1 in 13 African American babies is born with sickle cell traitAbout 1 in every 365 black children is born with sickle cell diseaseSCD also affects some people who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.What are the symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD)?People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Early symptoms of SCD may include:Painful swelling of the hands and feetFatigue or fussiness from anemiaA yellowish color of the skin (jaundice) or the whites of the eyes (icterus)The effects of SCD vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. They may include severe pain, anemia, organ damage, and infections.How is sickle cell disease (SCD) diagnosed?A blood test can show if you have SCD or sickle cell trait. All states now test newborns as part of their screening programs, so treatment can begin early.People who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD.Doctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby).What are the treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD)?The only cure for SCD is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister.There are treatments that can help relieve symptoms, lessen complications, and prolong life:Antibiotics to try to prevent infections in younger childrenPain relievers for acute or chronic painHydroxyurea, a medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications. It increases the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood. This medicine is not right for everyone; talk to your health care provider about whether you should take it. This medicine is not safe during pregnancy.Childhood vaccinations to prevent infectionsBlood transfusions for severe anemia. If you have had some serious complications, such as a stroke, you may have transfusions to prevent more complications.There are other treatments for specific complications.To stay as healthy as possible, make sure that you get regular medical care, live a healthy lifestyle, and avoid situations that may set off a pain crisis.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}

{"id": "doc1", "contents": "Tremor  What is a tremor?A tremor is a rhythmic shaking movement in one or more parts of your body. It is involuntary, meaning that you cannot control it. This shaking happens because of muscle contractions.A tremor is most often in your hands, but it could also affect your arms, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. It may come and go, or it may be constant. Tremor can happen on its own or be caused by another disorder.What are the types of tremor?There are several types of tremor, including:Essential tremor, sometimes called benign essential tremor. This is the most common type. It usually affects your hands, but it can also affect your head, voice, tongue, legs, and trunk.Parkinsonian tremor, which is a common symptom in people who have Parkinson's disease. It is usually affects one or both hands when they are at rest, but it can affect the chin, lips, face, and legs.Dystonic tremor, which happens in people who have dystonia. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which you have involuntary muscle contractions. The contractions cause you to have twisting and repetitive movements. It can affect any muscle in the body.What causes tremor?Generally, tremor is caused by a problem in the deep parts of the brain that control movements. For most types, the cause is unknown. Some types are inherited and run in families. There can also be other causes, such as:Neurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and traumatic brain injuryCertain medicines, such as asthma medicines, amphetamines, caffeine, corticosteroids, and medicines used for certain psychiatric and neurological disordersAlcohol use disorder or alcohol withdrawalMercury poisoningHyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)Liver or kidney failureAnxiety or panicWho is at risk for tremor?Anyone can get tremor, but it is most common in middle-aged and older adults.

{"id": "doc3", "contents": "Hyperthyroidism  What is hyperthyroidism?Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs.Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. If not treated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with your heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle, and fertility. But there are treatments that can help.What causes hyperthyroidism?Hyperthyroidism has several causes. They include:Grave's disease, an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your thyroid and causes it to make too much hormone. This is the most common cause.Thyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults.Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland.Too much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.Too much thyroid medicine. This can happen if people who take thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) take too much of it.Who is at risk for hyperthyroidism?You are at higher risk for hyperthyroidism if you:Are a womanAre older than age 60Have been pregnant or had a baby within the past 6 monthsHave had thyroid surgery or a thyroid problem, such as goiterHave a family history of thyroid diseaseHave pernicious anemia, in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12Have type 1 diabetes or primary adrenal insufficiency, a hormonal disorderGet too much iodine, from eating large amounts of foods containing iodine or using iodine-containing medicines or supplementsWhat are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?The symptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include:Nervousness or irritabilityFatigueMuscle weaknessTrouble tolerating heatTrouble sleepingTremor, usually in your handsRapid and irregular heartbeatFrequent bowel movements or diarrheaWeight lossMood swingsGoiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing.Adults over age 60 may have different symptoms than younger adults. For example, they may lose their appetite or withdraw from other people. Sometimes this can be mistaken for depression or dementia.What other problems can hyperthyroidism cause?If hyperthyroidism isn't treated, it can cause some serious health problems, including:An irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure, and other heart problemsAn eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy. It can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and eye pain. In rare cases, it can lead to vision loss.Thinning bones and osteoporosisFertility problems in womenComplications in pregnancy, such as premature birth, low birth weight, high blood pressure in pregnancy, and miscarriageHow is hyperthyroidism diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, including asking about symptomsA physical examThyroid tests, such as"}

They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions, such as drug interactions, side effects, and allergies.What is a drug interaction?A drug interaction is a change in the way a drug acts in the body when taken with certain other drugs, foods, or supplements or when taken while you have certain medical conditions. Examples include:Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinnersDrugs and food, such as statins and grapefruitDrugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinnersDrugs and medical conditions, such as aspirin and peptic ulcersInteractions could cause a drug to be more or less effective, cause side effects, or change the way one or both drugs work.What are side effects?Side effects are unwanted, usually unpleasant, effects caused by medicines. Most are mild, such as a stomachache, dry mouth, or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the medicine.  Others can be more serious. Sometimes a drug can interact with a disease that you have and cause a side effect. For example, if you have a heart condition, certain decongestants can cause you to have a rapid heartbeat.What are drug allergies?Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can range from mild to life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is less common.How can I stay safe when taking medicines?When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medicine, make sure you understand how to take it correctly.

CP affects the cerebral motor cortex. This is the part of the brain that directs muscle movement. In fact, the first part of the name, cerebral, means having to do with the brain. The second part, palsy, means weakness or problems with using the muscles.What are the types of cerebral palsy (CP)?There are different types of CP:Spastic cerebral palsy, which is the most common type. It causes increased muscle tone, stiff muscles, and awkward movements. Sometimes it only affects one part of the body. In other cases, it can affect both arms and legs, the trunk, and the face.Dyskinetic cerebral palsy, which causes problems controlling the movement of the hands, arms, feet, and legs. This can make it hard to sit and walk.Ataxic cerebral palsy, which causes problems with balance and coordinationMixed cerebral palsy, which means that you have symptoms of more than one typeWhat causes cerebral palsy (CP)?CP is caused by abnormal development or damage to the developing brain. It could happen when:The cerebral motor cortex doesn't develop normally during fetal growthThere is an injury to the brain before, during, or after birthBoth the brain damage and the disabilities it causes are permanent.Who is at risk for cerebral palsy (CP)?CP is more common among boys than girls. It affects black children more often than white children.Certain medical conditions or events that can happen during pregnancy and delivery that may increase a baby's risk of being born with cerebral palsy, including:Being born too smallBeing born too earlyBeing born a twin or other multiple birthBeing conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other assisted reproductive technology (ART)Having a mother who had an infection during pregnancyHaving a mother with certain health problems in pregnancy, such as thyroid problemsSevere jaundiceHaving complications during birthRh incompatibilitySeizuresExposure to toxinsWhat are the signs of cerebral palsy (CP)?There are many different types and levels of disability with CP. So the signs can be different in each child.The signs usually appear in the early months of life. But sometimes there is a delay in getting a diagnosis until after age two. Infants with CP often have developmental delays. They are slow to reach developmental milestones such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk. They may also have abnormal muscle tone. They may seem floppy, or they may be stiff or rigid.It's important to know that children without CP can also have these signs. Contact your child's health care provider know if your child has any of these signs, so you can get a correct diagnosis.How is cerebral palsy (CP) diagnosed?Diagnosing CP involves several steps:Developmental monitoring (or surveillance) means tracking a child's growth and development over time. If there are any concerns about your child's development, then he or she should have a developmental screening test as soon as possible.Developmental screening involves a giving your child a short test to check for motor, movement, or other developmental delays.

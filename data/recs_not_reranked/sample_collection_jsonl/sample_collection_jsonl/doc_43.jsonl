{"id": "doc1", "contents": "Stroke  What is a stroke?A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someone's life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery.What are the types of stroke?There are two types of stroke:Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This is the most common type; about 80% of strokes are ischemic.Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brainAnother condition that's similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It's sometimes called a \"mini-stroke.\" TIAs happen when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time. The damage to the brain cells isn't permanent, but if you have had a TIA, you are at a much higher risk of having a stroke.Who is at risk for a stroke?Certain factors can raise your risk of a stroke. The major risk factors include:High blood pressure. This is the primary risk factor for a stroke.Diabetes.Heart diseases.Atrial fibrillation and other heart diseases can cause blood clots that lead to stroke.Smoking. When you smoke, you damage your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure.A personal or family history of stroke or TIA.Age. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older.Race and ethnicity. African Americans have a higher risk of stroke.There are also other factors that are linked to a higher risk of stroke, such as:Alcohol and illegal drug useNot getting enough physical activityHigh cholesterolUnhealthy dietHaving obesityWhat are the symptoms of stroke?The symptoms of stroke often happen quickly. They include:Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIf you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away.How are strokes diagnosed?To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:Ask about your symptoms and medical historyDo a physical exam, including a check of"}

It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die.  Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.Symptoms of stroke are:Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIt is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible.

Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after you've had certain viral infections such as a cold or the flu. Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including:Streptococcus pneumoniaeLegionella pneumophila; this pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' diseaseMycoplasma pneumoniaeChlamydia pneumoniaeHaemophilus influenzaeViruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include:Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)Some common cold and flu virusesSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19Fungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems.

It causes close to half a million illnesses each year.What causes C. diff infections?C. diff bacteria are commonly found in the environment, but people usually only get C. diff infections when they are taking antibiotics. That's because antibiotics not only wipe out bad germs, but they also kill the good germs that protect your body against infections. The effect of antibiotics can last as long as several months.

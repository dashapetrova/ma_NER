Most people with migraines have family members who have migraines.Have other medical conditions, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, sleep disorders, and epilepsy.What are the symptoms of migraines?There are four different phases of migraines. You may not always go through every phase each time you have a migraine.:Prodome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the migraine. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination.Aura. If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed. An aura can happen just before or during a migraine.Headache. A migraine usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe.

Some people have migraines at predictable times, such as before menstruation or on weekends following a stressful week of work.How are migraines diagnosed?To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:Take your medical historyAsk about your symptomsDo a physical and neurological examAn important part of diagnosing migraines is to rule out other medical conditions which could be causing the symptoms. So you may also have blood tests, an MRI or CT scan, or other tests.How are migraines treated?There is no cure for migraines. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks.There are different types of medicines to relieve symptoms. They include triptan drugs, ergotamine drugs, and pain relievers. The sooner you take the medicine, the more effective it is.There are also other things you can do to feel better:Resting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened roomPlacing a cool cloth or ice pack on your foreheadDrinking fluidsThere are some lifestyle changes you can make to prevent migraines:Stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback, may reduce the number and severity of migraines. Biofeedback uses electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension.Make a log of what seems to trigger your migraines. You can learn what you need to avoid, such as certain foods and medicines. It also help you figure out what you should do, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and eating regular meals.Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycleIf you have obesity, losing weight may also be helpfulIf you have frequent or severe migraines, you may need to take medicines to prevent further attacks. Talk with your health care provider about which drug would be right for you.Certain natural treatments, such as riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10, may help prevent migraines.

{"id": "doc3", "contents": "Concussion  A concussion is a type of brain injury.  It involves a short loss of normal brain function. It happens when a hit to the head or body causes your head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, creating chemical changes in your brain. Sometimes it can also stretch and damage your brain cells.Sometimes people call a concussion a \"mild\" brain injury. It is important to understand that while concussions may not be life-threatening, they can still be serious.Concussions are a common type of sports injury. Other causes of concussions include blows to the head, bumping your head when you fall, being violently shaken, and car accidents.Symptoms of a concussion may not start right away; they may start days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea, ringing in your ears, dizziness, or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury. Consult your health care professional if any of your symptoms get worse, or if you have more serious symptoms such as:Convulsions or seizuresDrowsiness or inability to wake upA headache that gets worse and does not go awayWeakness, numbness, or decreased coordinationRepeated vomiting or nauseaConfusionSlurred speechLoss of consciousnessTo diagnose a concussion, your health care provider will do a physical exam and will ask about your injury. You will most likely have a neurological exam, which checks your vision, balance, coordination, and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases, you may also have a scan of the brain, such as a CT scan or an MRI. A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain, as well as a skull fracture (break in the skull).Most people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning, you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration, such as studying, working on the computer, or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse. Then when your health care provider says that it is ok, you can start to return to your normal activities slowly.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}

{"id": "doc11", "contents": "Primary Ovarian Insufficiency  What is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure, happens when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40.Many women naturally experience reduced fertility when they are about 40 years old. They may start getting irregular menstrual periods as they transition to menopause. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility start before the age of 40. Sometimes it can start as early as the teenage years.POI is different from premature menopause. With premature menopause, your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. With POI, some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant.  In most cases of POI, the cause is unknown.What causes primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?In about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is unknown.Research shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles. Follicles are small sacs in your ovaries. Your eggs grow and mature inside them. One type of follicle problem is that you run out of working follicles earlier than normal. Another is that the follicles are not working properly. In most cases, the cause of the follicle problem is unknown. But sometimes the cause may be:Genetic disorders such as Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndromeA low number of folliclesAutoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis and Addison diseaseChemotherapy or radiation therapyMetabolic disordersToxins, such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, and pesticidesWho is at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?Certain factors can raise a woman's risk of POI:Family history. Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have it.Genes. Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. For example, women Fragile X syndrome or Turner syndrome are at higher risk.Certain diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and viral infectionsCancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapyAge. Younger women can get POI, but it becomes more common between the ages of 35-40.What are the symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?The first sign of POI is usually irregular or missed periods. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause:Hot flashesNight sweatsIrritabilityPoor concentrationDecreased sex drivePain during sexVaginal drynessFor many women with POI, trouble getting pregnant or infertility is the reason they go to their health care provider.What other problems can primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) cause?Since POI causes you to have lower levels of certain hormones, you are at greater risk for other health conditions, including:Anxiety and depression. Hormonal changes caused by POI can contribute to anxiety or lead to depression.Dry eye syndrome and eye surface disease. Some women with POI have one of these eye conditions. Both can cause discomfort and may lead to blurred vision. If not treated, these conditions can cause permanent eye damage.Heart disease. Lower levels of estrogen can affect the muscles lining the arteries and can increase the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. These factors increase your risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).Infertility.Low thyroid function. This problem also is called hypothyroidism. The thyroid is a gland that makes hormones that control your body's metabolism and energy level. Low levels thyroid hormones can affect your metabolism and can cause very low energy, mental sluggishness, and other symptoms.Osteoporosis. The hormone estrogen helps keep bones strong. Without enough estrogen, women with POI often develop osteoporosis. It is a bone disease that causes weak, brittle bones that are more likely to break.How is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnosed?To diagnose POI, your health care provider may do:A medical history, including asking whether you have relatives with POIA pregnancy test, to make sure that you are not pregnantA physical exam, to look for signs of other disorders which could be causing your symptomsBlood tests, to check for certain hormone levels. You may also have a blood test to do a chromosome analysis. A chromosome is the part of a cell that contains genetic information.A pelvic ultrasound, to see whether or not the ovaries are enlarged or have multiple folliclesHow is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) treated?Currently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries.  But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI. There are also ways to lower your health risks and treat the conditions that POI can cause:Hormone replacement therapy (HRT).HRT is the most common treatment. It gives your body the estrogen and other hormones that your ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual health and decreases the risks for heart disease and osteoporosis. You usually take it until about age 50; that's about the age when menopause usually begins.Calcium and vitamin D supplements. Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, you should take calcium and vitamin D every day.In vitro fertilization (IVF). If you have POI and you wish to become pregnant, you may consider trying IVF.Regular physical activity and a healthy body weight.Getting regular exercise and controlling your weight can lower your risk for osteoporosis and heart disease.Treatments for associated conditions. If you have a condition that is related to POI, it is important to treat that as well. Treatments may involve medicines and hormones.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"}

For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not \"push and crash.\" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again.Since the process of developing a treatment plan and attending to self-care can be hard if you have CFS, it is important to have support from family members and friends.Don't try any new treatments without talking to your health care provider.

A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.Infections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if you have a fever, it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system.Other causes of fevers include:Medicines, including some antibiotics, blood pressure medicines, and anti-seizure medicinesHeat illnessCancersAutoimmune diseasesSome childhood vaccinesTreatment depends on the cause of your fever.

When you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding.  After the bleeding stops and healing takes place, your body usually breaks down and removes the blood clot. But sometimes the blood clots form where they shouldn't, your body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or the blood clots don't break down like they should. These blood clots can be dangerous and may cause other health problems.Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the limbs, lungs, brain, heart, and kidneys. The types of problems blood clots can cause will depend on where they are:Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. It can block a vein and cause damage to your leg.A pulmonary embolism can happen when a DVT breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. It can damage your lungs and prevent your other organs from getting enough oxygen.Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare blood clot in the venous sinuses in your brain. Normally the venous sinuses drain blood from your brain. CVST blocks the blood from draining and can cause a hemorrhagic stroke.Blood clots in other parts of the body can cause problems such as an ischemic stroke, a heart attack, kidney problems, kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems.Who is at risk for blood clots?Certain factors can raise the risk of blood clots:AtherosclerosisAtrial fibrillationCancer and cancer treatmentsCertain genetic disordersCertain surgeriesCOVID-19DiabetesFamily history of blood clotsOverweight and obesityPregnancy and giving birthSerious injuriesSome medicines, including birth control pillsSmokingStaying in one position for a long time, such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane rideWhat are the symptoms of blood clots?The symptoms for blood clots can be different, depending on where the blood clot is:In the abdomen: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomitingIn an arm or leg: Sudden or gradual pain, swelling, tenderness, and warmthIn the lungs: Shortness of breath, pain with deep breathing, rapid breathing, and increased heart rateIn the brain: Trouble speaking, vision problems, seizures, weakness on one side of the body, and sudden severe headacheIn the heart: Chest pain, sweating, shortness of breath, and pain in the left armHow are blood clots diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose blood clots:A physical examA medical historyBlood tests, including a D-dimer testImaging tests, such as"}

{"id": "doc51", "contents": "Angioplasty  What is angioplasty?Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol, calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood.Angioplasty widens the blocked part of the artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).What conditions does angioplasty treat?Doctors use angioplasty to:Reduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary arteries. This type of pain is called angina. There are different types of angina. Angioplasty treats certain types.Limit damage to the heart during or right after a heart attack. In this case, angioplasty is an emergency treatment.Angioplasty does not cure coronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages, you'll need to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise.What happens during angioplasty?Most people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm.Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will:Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel.Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide.Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays.Replace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end.Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall. This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow.Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood clots from forming.What happens after an angioplasty?If you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots. Most people can return to their usual activities after a week.If you had an emergency angioplasty for a heart attack, you'll need to stay in the hospital for about a few more days.Are there any risks from angioplasty?Angioplasty is very safe. You may get a bruise, feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted. More serious problems don't happen very often, but they are possible. They can include serious bleeding, blood clots, and narrowing of the artery again.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute "}

This includes those who:Have immune system diseases such as HIV/AIDSHave certain cancersTake immunosuppressive drugs after an organ transplantYour immune system may be weaker when you have an infection or are stressed. This can raise your risk of shingles.It is rare, but possible, to get shingles more than once.What are the symptoms of shingles?Early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching. It is usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe.One to 14 days later, you will get a rash. It consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days. The rash is usually a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash.Some people may also have other symptoms:FeverHeadacheChillsUpset stomachWhat other problems can shingles cause?Shingles can cause complications:Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is most common complication of shingles.

These problems can be temporary or permanent.Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.How is shingles diagnosed?Usually your health care provider can diagnose shingles by taking your medical history and looking at your rash. In some cases, your provider may scrap off tissue from the rash or swab some fluid from the blisters and send the sample to a lab for testing.What are the treatments for shingles?There is no cure for shingles. Antiviral medicines may help to make the attack shorter and less severe. They may also help prevent PHN. The medicines are most effective if you can take them within 3 days after the rash appears. So if you think you might have shingles, contact your health care provider as soon as possible.Pain relievers may also help with the pain. A cool washcloth, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths may help relieve some of the itching.Can shingles be prevented?There are vaccines to prevent shingles or lessen its effects.

You will most likely have a neurological exam, which checks your vision, balance, coordination, and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases, you may also have a scan of the brain, such as a CT scan or an MRI. A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain, as well as a skull fracture (break in the skull).Most people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning, you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration, such as studying, working on the computer, or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse. Then when your health care provider says that it is ok, you can start to return to your normal activities slowly.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}

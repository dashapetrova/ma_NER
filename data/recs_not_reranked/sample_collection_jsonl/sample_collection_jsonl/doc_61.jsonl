{"id": "doc1", "contents": "Cancer  Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy, or stem cell transplantation.

The different parts of your throat are called the oropharynx, the hypopharynx, the nasopharynx, and the larynx, or voice box.The main risk factors for throat cancer are using tobacco heavy drinking. Certain types of throat cancer also have other risk factors. For example, having HPV is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer.Symptoms of throat cancer may include:A sore throat that does not go awayA lump in the neckPain or ringing in the earsTrouble swallowingEar painTo diagnose throat cancers, doctors may do a physical exam and history, imaging tests, and a biopsy. You may also need other tests, depending on the type of cancer. Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Treatment for some types of throat cancer may also include targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute"}

{"id": "doc6", "contents": "Breast Cancer  What is breast cancer?Breast cancer is a cancer that starts in breast tissue.  It happens when cells in the breast change and grow out of control. The cells usually form a tumor.Sometimes the cancer does not spread any further. This is called \"in situ.\" If the cancer spreads outside the breast, the cancer is called \"invasive.\" It may just spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes. Or the cancer may metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) through the lymph system or the blood.Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women in the United States. Rarely, it can also affect men.What are the types of breast cancer?There are different types of breast cancer. The types are based on which breast cells turn into cancer. The types include:Ductal carcinoma, which begins in the cells of the ducts. This is the most common type.Lobular carcinoma, which begins in the lobules. It is more often found in both breasts than other types of breast cancer.Inflammatory breast cancer, in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. The breast becomes warm, red, and swollen. This is a rare type.Paget's disease of the breast, which is a cancer involving the skin of the nipple. It usually also affects the darker skin around the nipple. It is also rare.What causes breast cancer?Breast cancer happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown.But sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Breast cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary breast cancer.There are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of breast cancer, including changes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. These two changes also raise your risk of ovarian and other cancers.Besides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of breast cancer.Who is at risk for breast cancer?The factors which raise your risk of breast cancer include:Older ageHistory of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast diseaseInherited risk of breast cancer, including having BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene changesDense breast tissueA reproductive history that leads to more exposure to the estrogen hormone, including"}

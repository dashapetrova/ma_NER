It is a common condition. It can range from being a minor problem to something that greatly affects your daily life.  In any case, it can get better with proper treatment.What are the types of urinary incontinence (UI)?There are several different types of UI. Each type has different symptoms and causes:Stress incontinence happens when stress or pressure on your bladder causes you to leak urine.  This could be due to coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, or physical activity. Causes include weak pelvic floor muscles and the bladder being out of its normal position.Urge, or urgency, incontinence happens when you have a strong urge (need) to urinate, and some urine leaks out before you can make it to the toilet. It is often related to an overactive bladder. Urge incontinence is most common in older people. It can sometimes be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It can also happen in some neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries.Overflow incontinence happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. This causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. Your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. This form of UI is most common in men. Some of the causes include tumors, kidney stones, diabetes, and certain medicines.Functional incontinence happens when a physical or mental disability, trouble speaking, or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. For example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with Alzheimer's disease may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet.Mixed incontinence means that you have more than one type of incontinence. It's usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence.Transient incontinence is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine. Once the cause is removed, the incontinence goes away.Bedwetting refers to urine leakage during sleep. This is most common in children, but adults can also have it."}

After age 55, women are more likely than men to develop it.Lifestyle - Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, such as eating too much sodium (salt) or not enough potassium, lack of exercise, drinking too much alcohol, and smoking.Family history - A family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing high blood pressureHow can I prevent high blood pressure?You can help prevent high blood pressure by having a healthy lifestyle. This means:Eating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.Getting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems.Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women only one.Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.If you already have high blood pressure, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications.

Some women may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn't know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia.Preeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. In rare cases, symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. Preeclampsia also includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidney.

They may include blood tests other lab tests to look for extra protein in the urine as well as other symptoms.What are the treatments for preeclampsia?Delivering the baby can often cure preeclampsia. When making a decision about treatment, your provider take into account several factors. They include how severe it is, how many weeks pregnant you are, and what the potential risks to you and your baby are:If you are more than 37 weeks pregnant, your provider will likely want to deliver the baby.If you are less than 37 weeks pregnant, your health care provider will closely monitor you and your baby. This includes blood and urine tests for you. Monitoring for the baby often involves ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, and checking on the baby's growth. You may need to take medicines, to control your blood pressure and to prevent seizures. Some women also get steroid injections, to help the baby's lungs mature faster. If the preeclampsia is severe, you provider may want you to deliver the baby early.The symptoms usually go away within 6 weeks of delivery. In rare cases, symptoms may not go away, or they may not start until after delivery (postpartum preeclampsia). This can be very serious, and it needs to be treated right away."}

Inflammation can damage organs.There are different types of hepatitis. One type, hepatitis C, is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness.Hepatitis C can be acute or chronic:Acute hepatitis C is a short-term infection. The symptoms can last up to 6 months. Sometimes your body is able to fight off the infection and the virus goes away. But for most people, an acute infection leads to chronic infection.Chronic hepatitis C is a long-lasting infection. If it is not treated, it can last for a lifetime and cause serious health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer, and even death.How is hepatitis C spread?Hepatitis C spreads through contact with the blood of someone who has HCV. This contact may be through:Sharing drug needles or other drug materials with someone who has HCV. In the United States, this is the most common way that people get hepatitis C.Getting an accidental stick with a needle that was used on someone who has HCV. This can happen in health care settings.Being tattooed or pierced with tools or inks that were not sterilized after being used on someone who has HCVHaving contact with the blood or open sores of someone who has HCVSharing personal care items that may have come in contact with another person's blood, such as razors or toothbrushesBeing born to a mother with HCVHaving unprotected sex with someone who has HCVBefore 1992, hepatitis C was also commonly spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Since then, there has been routine testing of the U.S. blood supply for HCV. It is now very rare for someone to get HCV this way.Who is at risk for hepatitis C?You are more likely to get hepatitis C if you:Have injected drugsHad a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992Have hemophilia and received clotting factor before 1987Have been on kidney dialysisWere born between 1945 and 1965Have abnormal liver tests or liver diseaseHave been in contact with blood or infected needles at workHave had tattoos or body piercingsHave worked or lived in a prisonWere born to a mother with hepatitis CHave HIV/AIDSHave had more than one sex partner in the last 6 monthsHave had a sexually transmitted diseaseAre a man who has had sex with menIf you are at high risk for hepatitis C, your health care provider will likely recommend that you get tested for it.What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?Most people with hepatitis C have no symptoms. Some people with acute hepatitis C do have symptoms within 1 to 3 months after they are exposed to the virus. These symptoms may include:Dark yellow urineFatigueFeverGray- or clay-colored stoolsJoint painLoss of appetiteNausea and/or vomitingPain in your abdomenJaundice (yellowish eyes and skin)If you have chronic hepatitis C, you probably will not have symptoms until it causes complications. This can happen decades after you were infected. For this reason, hepatitis C screening is important, even if you have no symptoms.What other problems can hepatitis C cause?Without treatment, hepatitis C may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C can prevent these complications.How is hepatitis C diagnosed?Health care providers diagnose hepatitis C based on your medical history, a physical exam, and blood tests.If you do have hepatitis C, you may need additional tests to check for liver damage. These tests may include other blood tests, an ultrasound of the liver, and a liver biopsy.What are the treatments for hepatitis C?Treatment for hepatitis C is with antiviral medicines. They can cure the disease in most cases.If you have acute hepatitis C, your health care provider may wait to see if your infection becomes chronic before starting treatment.If your hepatitis C causes cirrhosis, you should see a doctor who specializes in liver diseases. Treatments for health problems related to cirrhosis include medicines, surgery, and other medical procedures. If your hepatitis C leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a liver transplant.Can hepatitis C be prevented?There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. But you can help protect yourself from hepatitis C infection by:Not sharing drug needles or other drug materialsWearing gloves if you have to touch another person's blood or open soresMaking sure your tattoo artist or body piercer uses sterile tools and unopened inkNot sharing personal items such toothbrushes, razors, or nail clippersUsing a latex condom during sex.

These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start.What are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?There is no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms. For example, physical and/or occupational therapy may help with arm or leg weakness. Researchers do not know the long-term outcomes of people with AFM.Can acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) be prevented?Since viruses likley play a role in AFM, you should take steps to help prevent getting or spreading viral infections by:Washing hands often with soap and waterAvoiding touching your face with unwashed handsAvoiding close contact with people who are sickCleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toysCovering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not handsStaying home when sickCenters for Disease Control and Prevention"}

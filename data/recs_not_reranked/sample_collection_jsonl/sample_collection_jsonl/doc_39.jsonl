Bilirubin is a yellow chemical in hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen in your red blood cells. As red blood cells break down, your body builds new cells to replace them. The old ones are processed by the liver. If the liver cannot handle the blood cells as they break down, bilirubin builds up in the body and your skin may look yellow.

CP affects the cerebral motor cortex. This is the part of the brain that directs muscle movement. In fact, the first part of the name, cerebral, means having to do with the brain. The second part, palsy, means weakness or problems with using the muscles.What are the types of cerebral palsy (CP)?There are different types of CP:Spastic cerebral palsy, which is the most common type. It causes increased muscle tone, stiff muscles, and awkward movements. Sometimes it only affects one part of the body. In other cases, it can affect both arms and legs, the trunk, and the face.Dyskinetic cerebral palsy, which causes problems controlling the movement of the hands, arms, feet, and legs. This can make it hard to sit and walk.Ataxic cerebral palsy, which causes problems with balance and coordinationMixed cerebral palsy, which means that you have symptoms of more than one typeWhat causes cerebral palsy (CP)?CP is caused by abnormal development or damage to the developing brain. It could happen when:The cerebral motor cortex doesn't develop normally during fetal growthThere is an injury to the brain before, during, or after birthBoth the brain damage and the disabilities it causes are permanent.Who is at risk for cerebral palsy (CP)?CP is more common among boys than girls. It affects black children more often than white children.Certain medical conditions or events that can happen during pregnancy and delivery that may increase a baby's risk of being born with cerebral palsy, including:Being born too smallBeing born too earlyBeing born a twin or other multiple birthBeing conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other assisted reproductive technology (ART)Having a mother who had an infection during pregnancyHaving a mother with certain health problems in pregnancy, such as thyroid problemsSevere jaundiceHaving complications during birthRh incompatibilitySeizuresExposure to toxinsWhat are the signs of cerebral palsy (CP)?There are many different types and levels of disability with CP. So the signs can be different in each child.The signs usually appear in the early months of life. But sometimes there is a delay in getting a diagnosis until after age two. Infants with CP often have developmental delays. They are slow to reach developmental milestones such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk. They may also have abnormal muscle tone.

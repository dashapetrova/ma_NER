The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes.Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep.What are the treatments for tonsillitis?Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take antibiotics. It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child.No matter what is causing the tonsillitis, there are some things you can do to help your child feel better.

{"id": "doc32", "contents": "Blood Clots  What is a blood clot?A blood clot is mass of blood that forms when platelets, proteins, and cells in the blood stick together. When you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding.  After the bleeding stops and healing takes place, your body usually breaks down and removes the blood clot. But sometimes the blood clots form where they shouldn't, your body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or the blood clots don't break down like they should. These blood clots can be dangerous and may cause other health problems.Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the limbs, lungs, brain, heart, and kidneys. The types of problems blood clots can cause will depend on where they are:Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. It can block a vein and cause damage to your leg.A pulmonary embolism can happen when a DVT breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. It can damage your lungs and prevent your other organs from getting enough oxygen.Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare blood clot in the venous sinuses in your brain. Normally the venous sinuses drain blood from your brain. CVST blocks the blood from draining and can cause a hemorrhagic stroke.Blood clots in other parts of the body can cause problems such as an ischemic stroke, a heart attack, kidney problems, kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems.Who is at risk for blood clots?Certain factors can raise the risk of blood clots:AtherosclerosisAtrial fibrillationCancer and cancer treatmentsCertain genetic disordersCertain surgeriesCOVID-19DiabetesFamily history of blood clotsOverweight and obesityPregnancy and giving birthSerious injuriesSome medicines, including birth control pillsSmokingStaying in one position for a long time, such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane rideWhat are the symptoms of blood clots?The symptoms for blood clots can be different, depending on where the blood clot is:In the abdomen: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomitingIn an arm or leg: Sudden or gradual pain, swelling, tenderness, and warmthIn the lungs: Shortness of breath, pain with deep breathing, rapid breathing, and increased heart rateIn the brain: Trouble speaking, vision problems, seizures, weakness on one side of the body, and sudden severe headacheIn the heart: Chest pain, sweating, shortness of breath, and pain in the left armHow are blood clots diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose blood clots:A physical examA medical historyBlood tests, including a D-dimer testImaging tests, such as"}

But they can stop those clots from getting bigger. It's important to treat blood clots, because clots in your blood vessels and heart can cause heart attacks, strokes, and blockages. Who needs blood thinners?You may need a blood thinner if you have:Certain heart or blood vessel diseasesAn abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillationA heart valve replacementA risk of blood clots after surgeryCongenital heart defectsWhat are the different types of blood thinners?There are different types of blood thinners:Anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin (also called Coumadin), slow down your body's process of making clots.Antiplatelets, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, prevent blood cells called platelets from clumping together to form a clot. Antiplatelets are mainly taken by people who have had a heart attack or stroke.How can I take blood thinners safely?When you take a blood thinner, follow the directions carefully. Blood thinners may interact with certain foods, medicines, vitamins, and alcohol. Make sure that your health care provider knows all of the medicines and supplements you are using.You may need regular blood tests to check how well your blood is clotting. It is important to make sure that you're taking enough medicine to prevent clots, but not so much that it causes bleeding.What are the side effects of blood thinners?Bleeding is the most common side effect of blood thinners. They can also cause an upset stomach, nausea, and diarrhea. "}

For example, surgery for a severe heart attack may need to be done right away. In other cases, you can plan heart surgery ahead of time. Some heart surgeries are major operations, such as heart bypass surgery for blocked arteries in the heart. Other surgeries are more minor heart procedures, such as putting in a pacemaker.What conditions does heart surgery treat?There are different types of heart surgery that can help treat many heart conditions:What conditions does heart surgery treat?What does the heart surgery do?Coronary artery disease (CAD) - when a sticky substance called plaque narrows or blocks the arteries that supply blood to your heart muscle.Makes a new path for blood to flow around the blocked part of an artery in the heart. This is called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults.Heart valve diseases - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through your heart.Repairs heart valves.Replaces heart valves with a mechanical valve or a biologic valve made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue.Arrhythmia - problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They are caused by changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat.Places a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in the chest to correct your heartbeat.Treats atrial fibrillation with small cuts in the heart muscle. The cuts form scars that make a path for the heart's electrical signals (Maze surgery).Heart failure - when your heart is too weak or stiff to pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs.Places a device in the chest which may include:An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to help prevent sudden cardiac arrest.A biventricular pacemaker to coordinate the heart's pumping action so it's more powerful.A ventricular assist device to help the heart pump blood.A total artificial heart to pump blood for the heart.Replaces a seriously diseased heart with a heathy heart (heart transplantation).Heart aneurysm - a balloon-like bulge in the wall of an artery. It can be life-threatening if the aneurysm tears or bursts.Repairs or replaces the weak part of a heart artery using a patch or a tube made of fabric.Angina - chest pain from coronary artery disease.Uses a laser to make small channels through part of the heart muscle (transmyocardial laser revascularization).Damaged and abnormal heart structures, including congenital heart defects - heart structure problems that you're born with.Repairs heart damage or problems with how the heart and blood vessels are formed. Repairs depend on the type of defect or damage.What approaches do surgeons use to do heart surgery?The approach a surgeon uses to do heart surgery depends on your heart problem, your general health, and other factors. Approaches to heart surgery include:Open-heart surgery (also called traditional heart surgery) is when the surgeon cuts the chest open to reach the heart. Because it's difficult to operate on a beating heart, medicines are used to stop the heart. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood pumping through the body during the surgery.Off-pump heart surgery is open-heart surgery on a beating heart without using a heart-lung bypass machine. The surgeon holds the heart steady with a device. Surgeons may use off-pump heart surgery to do coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), but only in certain cases.Minimally invasive heart surgery uses small cuts between the ribs. The cuts may be as small as 2 to 3 inches. The surgeon inserts tools into the chest through the cuts. This type of heart surgery may or may not use a heart-lung bypass machine.Robotic-assisted surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. This allows the surgeon to be very accurate when doing difficult operations.What are the risks of heart surgery?Like all surgery, heart surgery has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks include:BleedingInfection, fever, and swellingA problem from anesthesia (medicine that makes you sleep during surgery)ArrhythmiaDamage to the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungsStrokeThe risks of heart surgery tend to be higher if:The surgery is an emergency.You have other medical conditions, including:"}

After age 55, women are more likely than men to develop it.Lifestyle - Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, such as eating too much sodium (salt) or not enough potassium, lack of exercise, drinking too much alcohol, and smoking.Family history - A family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing high blood pressureHow can I prevent high blood pressure?You can help prevent high blood pressure by having a healthy lifestyle. This means:Eating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.Getting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems.Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women only one.Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.Managing stress.

You usually don't have any other symptoms. In many cases, it does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. But it does raise your risk of high blood pressure in the future. It sometimes can be severe, which may lead to low birth weight or preterm birth. Some women with gestational hypertension do go on to develop preeclampsia.Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that started before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some women may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn't know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia.Preeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. In rare cases, symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. Preeclampsia also includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidney.

It is rare, but very serious.What are the symptoms of preeclampsia?Possible symptoms of preeclampsia include:High blood pressureToo much protein in your urine (called proteinuria)Swelling in your face and hands. Your feet may also swell, but many women have swollen feet during pregnancy. So swollen feet by themselves may not be a sign of a problem.Headache that does not go awayVision problems, including blurred vision or seeing spotsPain in your upper right abdomenTrouble breathingEclampsia can also cause seizures, nausea and/or vomiting, and low urine output. If you go on to develop HELLP syndrome, you may also have bleeding or bruising easily, extreme fatigue, and liver failure.How is preeclampsia diagnosed?Your health care provider will check your blood pressure and urine at each prenatal visit. If your blood pressure reading is high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, your provider will likely want to run some tests. They may include blood tests other lab tests to look for extra protein in the urine as well as other symptoms.What are the treatments for preeclampsia?Delivering the baby can often cure preeclampsia. When making a decision about treatment, your provider take into account several factors. They include how severe it is, how many weeks pregnant you are, and what the potential risks to you and your baby are:If you are more than 37 weeks pregnant, your provider will likely want to deliver the baby.If you are less than 37 weeks pregnant, your health care provider will closely monitor you and your baby. This includes blood and urine tests for you. Monitoring for the baby often involves ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, and checking on the baby's growth. You may need to take medicines, to control your blood pressure and to prevent seizures. Some women also get steroid injections, to help the baby's lungs mature faster. If the preeclampsia is severe, you provider may want you to deliver the baby early.The symptoms usually go away within 6 weeks of delivery.

{"id": "doc47", "contents": "Joint Disorders  What are joints?Your joints are places where two or more bones come together. Your shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and knuckles are all joints. Your spine has joints, too.But joints are more than bones. They include the soft tissues around them, such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments. Cartilage is the hard slippery flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. Tendons are tough, flexible bands that connect your muscles to your bones so you can move your joints. Ligaments connect the bones of the joint to each other to keep them stable when you move.What are joint disorders?Joint disorders are diseases or injuries that affect your joints. Injuries can happen because of overuse of a joint. Or you could have a sudden injury, such as an accident or a sports injury.What diseases can affect the joints?Many diseases can affect the joints. They often cause joint pain and make your joints stiff, red, or swollen. Most of them are chronic. That means they last a long time. Some may never go away completely. Some of the diseases that affect the joints include:Arthritis. Arthritis may cause joint pain and swelling. There are many types of this disease. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. Over time, arthritis can cause severe joint damage. It can affect people of all ages. A joint injury when you're young may cause osteoarthritis later in life.Lupus. This autoimmune disease affects many parts of the body and can cause joint and muscle pain. Some types of lupus often cause arthritis.Sjögren's Syndrome. This autoimmune disease affects glands that make moisture in many parts of the body. The main symptoms are dry eyes and mouth, but it often causes joint pain, too.Treatments are different depending on the disease. But most treatments include medicines and therapies to relieve pain and other symptoms.What types of joint disorders happen from sudden injuries?Joint disorders from sudden injuries include:Sprains and strains. Sprains are stretched or torn ligaments. Acute strains are stretched or torn muscles or tendons that happen from a sudden injury or movement, such as lifting a heavy object.Dislocated joints. A joint is dislocated when the bones are pushed or pulled out of position. A joint dislocation is a medical emergency.Treatment depends on the type of injury. You can treat many sports injuries at home. But you should call your health care provider if you:Have a lot of joint pain, swelling or numbnessCan't put weight on the jointHave pain from an old injury with more swelling, an unstable joint, or a joint that isn't normal in another wayWhat types of joint disorders happen from overuse?Overuse injuries usually damage the soft tissues of the joint. They can happen when you work a joint too hard by doing the same movements over and over. For example, you could get an overuse injury from playing a musical instrument, playing sports, or doing certain jobs, such as carpentry or painting.Joint overuse injuries include:Bursitis. The bursa is a small fluid-filled sac. It works as a pad between the bones of a joint and the moving parts around it, such as muscles, tendons and skin. With bursitis, the bursa becomes irritated and swollen with extra fluid. Overuse is the most common cause, but injuries, infections and other conditions, such as arthritis, can cause bursitis.Tendinitis. This condition happens when you overuse a tendon. It swells and makes the joint painful to move.Chronic strain. A strain becomes chronic when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear slowly over time from repeating the same movements.The treatments for bursitis, tendinitis, and chronic strain are often the same. They usually include rest, keeping the injured joint higher than your heart, and taking medicine to reduce swelling. Your provider may recommend gentle exercise and other treatment. In some cases, your provider may suggest an injection (a shot) of medicine into the joint. If these do not help, you may need surgery.How can I keep my joints healthy?Getting enough physical activity is one of the most important things you can do to prevent or slow joint disorders. Activity strengthens the muscles around your joints and helps them work better.When you play sports, wear the right equipment to protect your joints, such as knee pads.

{"id": "doc58", "contents": "Sickle Cell Disease  What is sickle cell disease (SCD)?Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. If you have SCD, there is a problem with your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood cells. This changes the shape of the red blood cells. The cells are supposed to be disc-shaped, but this changes them into a crescent, or sickle, shape.The sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The sickle cells usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new cells to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood cells. This is a condition called anemia, and it can make you feel tired.The sickle-shaped cells can also stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen can't reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These attacks can occur without warning. If you get one, you might need to go to the hospital for treatment.What causes sickle cell disease (SCD)?The cause of SCD is a defective gene, called a sickle cell gene. People with the disease are born with two sickle cell genes, one from each parent.If you are born with one sickle cell gene, it's called sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy, but they can pass the defective gene on to their children.Who is at risk for sickle cell disease (SCD)?In the United States, most of the people with SCD are African Americans:About 1 in 13 African American babies is born with sickle cell traitAbout 1 in every 365 black children is born with sickle cell diseaseSCD also affects some people who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.What are the symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD)?People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Early symptoms of SCD may include:Painful swelling of the hands and feetFatigue or fussiness from anemiaA yellowish color of the skin (jaundice) or the whites of the eyes (icterus)The effects of SCD vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. They may include severe pain, anemia, organ damage, and infections.How is sickle cell disease (SCD) diagnosed?A blood test can show if you have SCD or sickle cell trait. All states now test newborns as part of their screening programs, so treatment can begin early.People who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD.Doctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby).What are the treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD)?The only cure for SCD is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister.There are treatments that can help relieve symptoms, lessen complications, and prolong life:Antibiotics to try to prevent infections in younger childrenPain relievers for acute or chronic painHydroxyurea, a medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications. It increases the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood. This medicine is not right for everyone; talk to your health care provider about whether you should take it. This medicine is not safe during pregnancy.Childhood vaccinations to prevent infectionsBlood transfusions for severe anemia. If you have had some serious complications, such as a stroke, you may have transfusions to prevent more complications.There are other treatments for specific complications.To stay as healthy as possible, make sure that you get regular medical care, live a healthy lifestyle, and avoid situations that may set off a pain crisis.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}

For example, iron is part of hemoglobin, a protein which carries oxygen from our lungs throughout our bodies. It helps our muscles store and use oxygen. Iron is also part of many other proteins and enzymes.Your body needs the right amount of iron. If you have too little iron, you may develop iron deficiency anemia. Causes of low iron levels include blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from foods. People at higher risk of having too little iron are young children and women who are pregnant or have periods.Too much iron can damage your body.  Taking too many iron supplements can cause iron poisoning. Some people have an inherited disease called hemochromatosis.  It causes too much iron to build up in the body.

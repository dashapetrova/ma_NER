In serious cases, the coughing can become violent and rapid. You may cough so hard that you vomit. The name of the disease comes from the whooping noise you might make when you try to breathe in after coughing.Whooping cough is very contagious and can affect anyone. But it can be especially serious in babies who did not yet get the vaccine. About half of babies under age one who get whooping cough need care in the hospital.What causes whooping cough?Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. It spreads from person to person. People who have pertussis usually spread it through coughing, sneezing, or breathing very close to someone. It can also sometimes be spread by touching an infected surface and then touching your nose or mouth.If you get pertussis, you are contagious for about 2 weeks after you start coughing. Antibiotics may shorten the time that you are contagious.What are the symptoms of whooping cough?The symptoms of pertussis usually start within 5 to 10 days after you are exposed. But sometimes you may not get symptoms until up to 3 weeks later.Whooping cough usually starts with cold-like symptoms. They may last for 1 to 2 weeks and can include:Runny noseMild feverMild, occasional coughThe early symptoms in babies can be different. They may only cough a little bit, or they may not cough at all. Babies may have apnea, which means that there is a pause in breathing. They may start to turn blue.

Whooping cough causes uncontrollable coughing. Vaccines can protect you from these diseases. In the U.S., there are four combination vaccines:DTaP prevents all three diseases.

You may have a sunburn-like rash somewhere on your body. TSS can lead to organ failure.How are staph infections diagnosed?Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Often, providers can tell if you have a staph skin infection by looking at it. To check for other types of staph infections, providers may do a culture, with a skin scraping, tissue sample, stool sample, or throat or nasal swabs. There may be other tests, such as imaging tests, depending on the type of infection.What are the treatments for staph infections?Treatment for staph infections is antibiotics. Depending on the type of infection, you may get a cream, ointment, medicines (to swallow), or intravenous (IV). If you have an infected wound, your provider might drain it.

But sometimes the blood clots form where they shouldn't, your body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or the blood clots don't break down like they should. These blood clots can be dangerous and may cause other health problems.Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the limbs, lungs, brain, heart, and kidneys. The types of problems blood clots can cause will depend on where they are:Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. It can block a vein and cause damage to your leg.A pulmonary embolism can happen when a DVT breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. It can damage your lungs and prevent your other organs from getting enough oxygen.Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare blood clot in the venous sinuses in your brain. Normally the venous sinuses drain blood from your brain. CVST blocks the blood from draining and can cause a hemorrhagic stroke.Blood clots in other parts of the body can cause problems such as an ischemic stroke, a heart attack, kidney problems, kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems.Who is at risk for blood clots?Certain factors can raise the risk of blood clots:AtherosclerosisAtrial fibrillationCancer and cancer treatmentsCertain genetic disordersCertain surgeriesCOVID-19DiabetesFamily history of blood clotsOverweight and obesityPregnancy and giving birthSerious injuriesSome medicines, including birth control pillsSmokingStaying in one position for a long time, such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane rideWhat are the symptoms of blood clots?The symptoms for blood clots can be different, depending on where the blood clot is:In the abdomen: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomitingIn an arm or leg: Sudden or gradual pain, swelling, tenderness, and warmthIn the lungs: Shortness of breath, pain with deep breathing, rapid breathing, and increased heart rateIn the brain: Trouble speaking, vision problems, seizures, weakness on one side of the body, and sudden severe headacheIn the heart: Chest pain, sweating, shortness of breath, and pain in the left armHow are blood clots diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose blood clots:A physical examA medical historyBlood tests, including a D-dimer testImaging tests, such as"}

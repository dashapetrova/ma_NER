This means:</p><ul><li>Eating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.</li><li>Getting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.</li><li>Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> and reduce your risk for other health problems.</li><li>Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women only one.</li><li>Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.</li><li>Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.</li></ul><p>If you already have <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You should get regular medical care and follow your prescribed treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines.</p><p>NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>\\n',\n",

It starts after you are 20 weeks pregnant. You usually don\\'t have any other symptoms. In many cases, it does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. But it does raise your risk of <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> in the future. It sometimes can be severe, which may lead to low birth weight or preterm birth. Some women with gestational <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">hypertension</span></span> do go on to develop preeclampsia.</li><li>Chronic <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">hypertension is high blood pressure</span></span> that started before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some women may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn\\'t know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">hypertension</span></span> can also lead to preeclampsia.</li><li>Preeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. In rare cases, symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. Preeclampsia also includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidney. The signs may include protein in the urine and very <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>.

It is rare, but very serious.</li></ul>What are the symptoms of preeclampsia?<p>Possible symptoms of preeclampsia include:</p><ul><li><span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">High blood pressure</span></span></li><li>Too much protein in your urine (called proteinuria)</li><li>Swelling in your face and hands. Your feet may also swell, but many women have swollen feet during pregnancy.

If you go on to develop HELLP syndrome, you may also have bleeding or bruising easily, extreme fatigue, and liver failure.</p>How is preeclampsia diagnosed?<p>Your health care provider will check your blood pressure and urine at each prenatal visit. If your blood pressure reading is high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, your provider will likely want to run some tests. They may include blood tests other lab tests to look for extra protein in the urine as well as other symptoms.</p>What are the treatments for preeclampsia?<p>Delivering the baby can often cure preeclampsia. When making a decision about treatment, your provider take into account several factors. They include how severe it is, how many weeks pregnant you are, and what the potential risks to you and your baby are:</p><ul><li>If you are more than 37 weeks pregnant, your provider will likely want to deliver the baby.</li><li>If you are less than 37 weeks pregnant, your health care provider will closely monitor you and your baby. This includes blood and urine tests for you. Monitoring for the baby often involves ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, and checking on the baby\\'s growth. You may need to take medicines, to control your blood pressure and to prevent seizures. Some women also get steroid injections, to help the baby\\'s lungs mature faster.

About 1 in 3 adults have <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, usually with no symptoms.

In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines.</p>How do blood pressure medicines work?<p>Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure:</p><ul><li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much</li><li>Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax.</li><li>Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.</li><li>Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions.</li></ul><p>Often, two or more medicines work better than one.

In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines.</p>How do blood pressure medicines work?<p>Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure:</p><ul><li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much</li><li>Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax.</li><li>Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.</li><li>Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions.</li></ul><p>Often, two or more medicines work better than one. While taking the medicines, it is still important to keep up with your healthy lifestyle changes.</p><p>NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>\\n',\n",

Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong.

These extra cells can form a mass called a <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\"><span class=\"qt2\">tumor. Tumors</span></span></span> can be benign or malignant.

The spread of <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\"><span class=\"qt2\">cancer</span></span></span> from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\"><span class=\"qt2\">cancer</span></span></span> type and how advanced it is.

Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.</li><li>Being at a healthy weight.

Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> and reduce your risk for other health problems.</li><li>Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women only one.</li><li>Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.</li><li>Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.</li></ul><p>If you already have <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications.

Preeclampsia can be serious or even life-threatening for both you and your baby.</li></ul>What causes preeclampsia?<p>The cause of preeclampsia is unknown.</p>Who is at risk for preeclampsia?<p>You are at higher risk of preeclampsia if you:</p><ul><li>Had chronic <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> or chronic kidney disease before pregnancy</li><li>Had <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> or preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy</li><li>Have obesity</li><li>Are over age 40</li><li>Are pregnant with more than one baby</li><li>Are African American</li><li>Have a family history of preeclampsia</li><li>Have certain health conditions, such as diabetes, lupus, or thrombophilia (a disorder which raises your risk of blood clots)</li><li>Used in vitro fertilization, egg donation, or donor insemination</li></ul>What problems can preeclampsia cause?<p>Preeclampsia can cause:</p><ul><li>Placental abruption, where the placenta separates from the uterus</li><li>Poor fetal growth, caused by a lack of nutrients and oxygen</li><li>Preterm birth</li><li>A low birth weight baby</li><li>Stillbirth</li><li>Damage to your kidneys, liver, brain, and other organ and blood systems</li><li>A higher risk of heart disease for you</li><li>Eclampsia, which happens when preeclampsia is severe enough to affect brain function, causing seizures or coma</li><li>HELLP syndrome, which happens when a woman with preeclampsia or eclampsia has damage to the liver and blood cells. It is rare, but very serious.</li></ul>What are the symptoms of preeclampsia?<p>Possible symptoms of preeclampsia include:</p><ul><li><span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">High blood pressure</span></span></li><li>Too much protein in your urine (called proteinuria)</li><li>Swelling in your face and hands. Your feet may also swell, but many women have swollen feet during pregnancy. So swollen feet by themselves may not be a sign of a problem.</li><li>Headache that does not go away</li><li>Vision problems, including blurred vision or seeing spots</li><li>Pain in your upper right abdomen</li><li>Trouble breathing</li></ul><p>Eclampsia can also cause seizures, nausea and/or vomiting, and low urine output. If you go on to develop HELLP syndrome, you may also have bleeding or bruising easily, extreme fatigue, and liver failure.</p>How is preeclampsia diagnosed?<p>Your health care provider will check your blood pressure and urine at each prenatal visit. If your blood pressure reading is high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, your provider will likely want to run some tests. They may include blood tests other lab tests to look for extra protein in the urine as well as other symptoms.</p>What are the treatments for preeclampsia?<p>Delivering the baby can often cure preeclampsia. When making a decision about treatment, your provider take into account several factors. They include how severe it is, how many weeks pregnant you are, and what the potential risks to you and your baby are:</p><ul><li>If you are more than 37 weeks pregnant, your provider will likely want to deliver the baby.</li><li>If you are less than 37 weeks pregnant, your health care provider will closely monitor you and your baby. This includes blood and urine tests for you. Monitoring for the baby often involves ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, and checking on the baby\\'s growth. You may need to take medicines, to control your blood pressure and to prevent seizures. Some women also get steroid injections, to help the baby\\'s lungs mature faster. If the preeclampsia is severe, you provider may want you to deliver the baby early.</li></ul><p>The symptoms usually go away within 6 weeks of delivery. In rare cases, symptoms may not go away, or they may not start until after delivery (postpartum preeclampsia). This can be very serious, and it needs to be treated right away.</p>\\n',\n",

In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines.</p>How do blood pressure medicines work?<p>Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure:</p><ul><li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much</li><li>Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax.</li><li>Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.</li><li>Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions.</li></ul><p>Often, two or more medicines work better than one.

This means:</p><ul><li>Eating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.</li><li>Getting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.</li><li>Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> and reduce your risk for other health problems.</li><li>Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women only one.</li><li>Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.</li><li>Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.</li></ul><p>If you already have <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You should get regular medical care and follow your prescribed treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines.</p><p>NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>\\n',\n",

About 1 in 3 adults have <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, usually with no symptoms. But it can cause serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, heart attack, and kidney disease.</p>What lifestyle changes can help lower <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>?<p>Healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>:</p><ul><li>Losing weight</li><li>Being physically active</li><li>Managing stress</li><li>Reducing sodium in your diet</li><li>Avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs</li><li>Getting enough sleep</li></ul>What if lifestyle changes alone cannot lower blood pressure?<p>Sometimes lifestyle changes alone cannot control or lower your <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines.</p>How do blood pressure medicines work?<p>Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure:</p><ul><li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much</li><li>Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax.</li><li>Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.</li><li>Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions.</li></ul><p>Often, two or more medicines work better than one. While taking the medicines, it is still important to keep up with your healthy lifestyle changes.</p><p>NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>\\n',\n",

Many of those people don\\'t know they have it, because there are usually no warning signs. This can be dangerous, because <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> can lead to life-threatening conditions like heart attack or stroke. The good news is that you can often prevent or treat <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Early diagnosis and heart-healthy lifestyle changes can keep <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> from seriously damaging your health.</p>What is blood pressure?<p>Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">blood pressure is highest</span></span> when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.</p><p>Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.</p>How is <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> diagnosed?<p><span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">High blood pressure</span></span> usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. He or she will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis.</p>Blood Pressure CategorySystolic Blood PressureDiastolic Blood PressureNormalLess than 120andLess than 80High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors)140 or higheror90 or higherHigh Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers)130 or higheror80 or higherDangerously <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> - seek medical care right away180 or higherand120 or higher<p>For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and gender.</p><p>People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80.</p>Who is at risk for <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>?<p>Anyone can develop <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, but there are certain factors that can increase your risk:</p><ul><li>Age - Blood pressure tends to rise with age</li><li>Race/Ethnicity - <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">High blood pressure</span></span> is more common in African American adults</li><li>Weight - People who are overweight or have obesity are more likely to develop <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span></li><li>Sex - Before age 55, men are more likely than women to develop <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>.

This means:</p><ul><li>Eating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.</li><li>Getting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.</li><li>Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> and reduce your risk for other health problems.</li><li>Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women only one.</li><li>Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.</li><li>Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.</li></ul><p>If you already have <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You should get regular medical care and follow your prescribed treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines.</p><p>NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>\\n',\n",
              " '<h1>Non-Drug <span class=\"qt1\">Pain</span> Management</h1> \\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/nondrugpainmanagement.html\\nWhat is <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>?<p><span class=\"qt1\">Pain</span> is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or <span class=\"qt1\">ache. Pain</span> may be sharp or dull. It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen, chest, pelvis, or you may feel <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> all over.</p><p>There are two types of <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>:</p><ul><li>Acute <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> usually comes on suddenly, because of a disease, injury, or inflammation. It can often be diagnosed and treated. It usually goes away, though sometimes it can turn into <span class=\"qt0\">chronic</span> <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>.</li><li><span class=\"qt0\">Chronic</span> <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> lasts for a long time, and can cause severe problems</li></ul>What are <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> relievers?<p><span class=\"qt1\">Pain</span> relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>. There are many different <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> medicines, and each one has advantages and risks. Some are over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Others are stronger medicines, which are available by prescription. The most powerful prescription <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> relievers are opioids. They are very effective, but people who take them are at risk of addiction and overdose.</p><p>Because of the side effects and risks of <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> relievers, you may want to try non-drug treatments first. And if you do need to take medicines, also doing some non-drug treatments may allow you to take a lower dose.</p>What are some non-drug treatments for <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>?<p>There are many non-drug treatments that can help with <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>. It is important to check with your health care provider before trying any of them:</p><ul><li>Acupuncture involves stimulating acupuncture points. These are specific points on your body. There are different acupuncture methods. The most common one involves inserting thin needles through the skin. Others include using pressure, electrical stimulation, and heat. Acupuncture is based on the belief that qi (vital energy) flows through the body along paths, called meridians. Practitioners believe that stimulating the acupuncture points can rebalance the qi. Research suggests that acupuncture can help manage certain <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> conditions.</li><li>Biofeedback techniques use electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate. This teaches you to be more aware of your body functions so you can learn to control them. For example, a biofeedback device may show you measurements of your muscle tension. By watching how these measurements change, you can become more aware of when your muscles are tense and learn to relax them. Biofeedback may help to control <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>, including <span class=\"qt0\">chronic</span> headaches and back <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>.</li><li>Electrical stimulation involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. This can help treat <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> by interrupting or blocking the <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> signals. Types include</li><ul><li>Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS)</li><li>Implanted electric nerve stimulation</li><li>Deep brain or spinal cord stimulation</li></ul><li>Massage therapy is a treatment in which the soft tissues of the body are kneaded, rubbed, tapped, and stroked. Among other benefits, it may help people relax, and relieve stress and <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>.</li><li>Meditation is a mind-body practice in which you focus your attention on something, such as an object, word, phrase, or breathing. This helps you to minimize distracting or stressful thoughts or feelings.</li><li>Physical therapy uses techniques such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation. It can help to control <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>, as well as condition muscles and restore strength.</li><li>Psychotherapy (talk therapy) uses methods such as discussion, listening, and counseling to treat mental and behavioral disorders. It can also help people who have <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>, especially <span class=\"qt0\">chronic</span> <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>, by</li><ul><li>Teaching them coping skills, to be able to better deal with the stress that <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> can cause</li><li>Addressing negative thoughts and emotions that can make <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> worse</li><li>Providing them with support</li></ul><li>Relaxation therapy can help reduce muscle tension and stress, lower blood pressure, and control <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>. It may involve tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body. It may be used with guided imagery (focusing the mind on positive images) and meditation.</li><li>Surgery can sometimes be necessary to treat severe <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>, especially when it is caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries. There are always risks to getting surgery, and it does not always work to treat <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>. So it is important to go through all of the risks and benefits with your health care provider.</li></ul>\\n']"

The damage affects your spinal cord and the nerves that control muscle movement in your arms and legs. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15. The main symptom is ataxia, which means trouble coordinating movements. Specific symptoms include: Difficulty walking Muscle weakness Speech problems Involuntary eye movements Scoliosis (curving of the spine to one side) Heart palpitations, from the heart disease which can happen along with Friedreich ataxia People with Friedreich ataxia usually need a wheelchair 15 to 20 years after symptoms first appear. In severe cases, people become incapacitated. There is no cure. You can treat symptoms with medicines, braces, surgery, and physical therapy.

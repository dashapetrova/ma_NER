              " '<h1>Spinal Muscular Atrophy</h1> \\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/spinalmuscularatrophy.html\\nWhat is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?<p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of genetic diseases that damages and kills motor neurons. Motor neurons are a type of nerve cell in the spinal cord and <span class=\"qt1\">lower</span> part of the brain. They control movement in your arms, legs, face, chest, throat, and tongue.</p><p>As the motor neurons die off, your muscles start to weaken and atrophy (waste away). The muscle damage gets worse over time and can affect speaking, walking, swallowing, and breathing.</p>What are the types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and what are their symptoms?<p>There are different types of SMA. They are based on how serious the disease is and when the symptoms start:</p><ul><li>Type l is also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease or infantile-onset SMA. It is the most <span class=\"qt0\">severe</span> type. It is also the most common. Babies with this type usually show signs of the disease before 6 months of age. In more <span class=\"qt0\">severe</span> cases, the signs show up even before or just after birth (Types 0 or 1A). The babies may have trouble swallowing and breathing and may not move around a lot. They have chronic shortening of muscles or tendons (called contractures). They usually cannot sit up without help. Without treatment, many children with this type will die before 2 years of age.</li><li>Type ll is a moderate to <span class=\"qt0\">severe</span> type of SMA. It usually first noticed between 6 and 18 months of age. Most children with this type can sit without support but cannot stand or walk without help. They may also have trouble breathing. They can usually live into adolescence or young adulthood.</li><li>Type lll is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease. It is the mildest type that affects children. The signs of the disease usually show up after age 18 months. Children with this type can walk by themselves but may have trouble running, getting up from a chair, or climbing stairs. They may also have scoliosis (curvature of the spine), contractures, and respiratory infections. With treatment, most children with this type will have a normal lifespan.</li><li>Type IV is rare and often mild. It usually causes symptoms after 21 years of age. The symptoms include mild to moderate leg muscle <span class=\"qt4\">weakness</span>, tremors, and mild breathing problems. The symptoms slowly get worse over time. People with this type of SMA have a normal lifespan.</li></ul>What causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?<p>Most types of SMA are caused by a change in the SMN1 gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein that the motor neurons need to be healthy and to function. But when part of the SMN1 gene is missing or abnormal, there isn\\'t enough protein for the motor neurons. This causes the motor neurons to die off.</p><p>Most people have two copies of the SM1 gene - one from each parent. SMA normally only happens when both copies have the gene change. If only one copy has the change, there usually aren\\'t any symptoms. But that gene could be passed down from parent to child.</p><p>Some of the less common types of SMA may be caused by changes in other genes.</p>How is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) diagnosed?<p>Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose SMA:</p><ul><li>A physical exam</li><li>A medical history, including asking about family history</li><li>Genetic testing to check for the gene changes that cause SMA</li><li>Electromyography and nerve conduction studies and a muscle biopsy may be done, especially if no gene changes were found</li></ul><p>Parents who have a family history of SMA may want to do a prenatal test to check to see whether their baby has an SMN1 gene change. An amniocentesis or in some cases a chorionic villi sampling (CVS) is used to get the sample for testing.</p><p>In some states, genetic testing for SMA is part of newborn screening tests.</p>What are the treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?<p>There is no cure for SMA. Treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. They may include:</p><ul><li>Medicines to help the body make more of the proteins that the motor neurons need</li><li>Gene therapy for children under 2 years of age</li><li>Physical, occupational, and rehabilitation therapy to help to improve posture and the mobility of the joints. These therapies may also improve blood flow and slow muscle <span class=\"qt4\">weakness</span> and atrophy. Some people may also need therapy for trouble speaking, chewing, and swallowing.</li><li>Assistive devices such as supports or braces, orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs to help people stay more independent</li><li>Good nutrition and a balanced diet to help maintain weight and strength. Some people might need a feeding tube in order to get the nutrition they need.</li><li>Breathing support for people who have muscle <span class=\"qt4\">weakness</span> in the neck, throat, and chest. The support may include devices to help with breathing during the day and to prevent sleep apnea at night. Some people might need to be on a ventilator.</li></ul><p>NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</p>\\n',\n",

It happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is briefly blocked. Symptoms of a TIA are like other stroke symptoms, but do not last as long. They happen suddenly, and include:</p><ul><li>Numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body</li><li>Confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech</li><li>Trouble seeing in one or both eyes</li><li><span class=\"qt0\">Difficulty</span> <span class=\"qt1\">walking</span></li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Loss of balance or coordination</li></ul><p>Most symptoms of a TIA disappear within an hour, although they may last for up to 24 hours.

              " '<h1>How to Prevent <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">High Blood Pressure</span></span></h1> \\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html\\n<p>More than 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. has <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure, or hypertension</span></span>. Many of those people don\\'t know they have it, because there are usually no warning signs. This can be dangerous, because <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> can lead to life-threatening conditions like heart attack or stroke. The good news is that you can often prevent or treat <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Early diagnosis and heart-healthy lifestyle changes can keep <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> from seriously damaging your health.</p>What is blood pressure?<p>Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">blood pressure is highest</span></span> when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.</p><p>Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.</p>How is <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> diagnosed?<p><span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">High blood pressure</span></span> usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. He or she will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis.</p>Blood Pressure CategorySystolic Blood PressureDiastolic Blood PressureNormalLess than 120andLess than 80High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors)140 or higheror90 or higherHigh Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers)130 or higheror80 or higherDangerously <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> - seek medical care right away180 or higherand120 or higher<p>For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and gender.</p><p>People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80.</p>Who is at risk for <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>?<p>Anyone can develop <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, but there are certain factors that can increase your risk:</p><ul><li>Age - Blood pressure tends to rise with age</li><li>Race/Ethnicity - <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">High blood pressure</span></span> is more common in African American adults</li><li>Weight - People who are overweight or have obesity are more likely to develop <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span></li><li>Sex - Before age 55, men are more likely than women to develop <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. After age 55, women are more likely than men to develop it.</li><li>Lifestyle - Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, such as eating too much sodium (salt) or not enough potassium, lack of exercise, drinking too much alcohol, and smoking.</li><li>Family history - A family history of <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> raises the risk of developing <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span></li></ul>How can I prevent <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>?<p>You can help prevent <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> by having a healthy lifestyle. This means:</p><ul><li>Eating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.</li><li>Getting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.</li><li>Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span> and reduce your risk for other health problems.</li><li>Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women only one.</li><li>Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.</li><li>Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.</li></ul><p>If you already have <span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt1\">high blood pressure</span></span>, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You should get regular medical care and follow your prescribed treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines.</p><p>NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>\\n']"

It happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is briefly blocked. Symptoms of a TIA are like other stroke symptoms, but do not last as long. They happen suddenly, and include:</p><ul><li>Numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body</li><li>Confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech</li><li>Trouble seeing in one or both eyes</li><li><span class=\"qt0\">Difficulty</span> <span class=\"qt1\">walking</span></li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Loss of balance or coordination</li></ul><p>Most symptoms of a TIA disappear within an hour, although they may last for up to 24 hours. Because you cannot tell if these symptoms are from a TIA or a stroke, you should go to the hospital right away.</p><p>TIAs are often a warning sign for future strokes. Taking medicine, such as blood thinners, may reduce your risk of a stroke. Your doctor might also recommend surgery. You can also help lower your risk by having a healthy lifestyle. This includes not smoking, not drinking too much, eating a healthy diet, and exercising.

              " '<h1>LDL: The \"Bad\" Cholesterol</h1> \\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/ldlthebadcholesterol.html\\nWhat is cholesterol?<p>Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that\\'s found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease.</p>What are LDL and HDL?<p>LDL and HDL are two types of lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. LDL and HDL have different purposes:</p><ul><li>LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol because a <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.</li><li>HDL stands for <span class=\"qt0\">high</span>-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body.</li></ul>How can a <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> LDL level raise my risk of coronary artery disease and other diseases?<p>If you have a <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> LDL level, this means that you have too much LDL cholesterol in your blood. This extra LDL, along with other substances, forms plaque. The plaque builds up in your arteries; this is a condition called atherosclerosis.</p><p>Coronary artery disease happens when the plaque buildup is in the arteries of your heart. It causes the arteries to become hardened and narrowed, which slows down or blocks the blood flow to your heart. Since your blood carries oxygen to your heart, this means that your heart may not be able to get enough oxygen. This can cause angina (chest pain), or if the blood flow is completely blocked, a heart attack.</p>How do I know what my LDL level is?<p>A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including LDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are:</p><p>For people who are age 19 or younger::</p><ul><li>The first test should be between ages 9 to 11</li><li>Children should have the test again every 5 years</li><li>Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke</li></ul><p>For people who are age 20 or older::</p><ul><li>Younger adults should have the test every 5 years</li><li>Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years</li></ul>What can affect my LDL level?<p>Things that can affect your LDL level include:</p><ul><li>Diet. Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise</li><li>Weight. Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level</li><li>Physical Activity. A lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain, which can raise your LDL level</li><li>Smoking.Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL from your arteries, if you have less HDL, that can contribute to you having a <span class=\"qt0\">higher</span> LDL level.</li><li>Age and Sex. As women and men get older, their cholesterol levels rise. Before the age of menopause, women have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age. After the age of menopause, women\\'s LDL levels tend to rise.</li><li>Genetics. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. <span class=\"qt0\">High</span> cholesterol can run in families. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> blood cholesterol.</li><li>Medicines. Certain medicines, including <span class=\"qt2\">steroids</span>, some blood pressure medicines, and HIV/AIDS medicines, can raise your LDL level.</li><li>Other medical conditions.

              " '<h1>HDL: The \"Good\" Cholesterol</h1> \\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/hdlthegoodcholesterol.html\\nWhat is cholesterol?<p>Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that\\'s found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease.</p>What are HDL and LDL?<p>HDL and LDL are two types of lipoproteins.They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein.  The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. HDL and LDL have different purposes:</p><ul><li>HDL stands for <span class=\"qt0\">high</span>-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body.</li><li>LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol because a <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.</li></ul>How do I know what my HDL level is?<p>A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including HDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are:</p><p>For people who are age 19 or younger::</p><ul><li>The first test should be between ages 9 to 11</li><li>Children should have the test again every 5 years</li><li>Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke</li></ul><p>For people who are age 20 or older::</p><ul><li>Younger adults should have the test every 5 years</li><li>Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years</li></ul>What should my HDL level be?<p> With HDL cholesterol, <span class=\"qt0\">higher</span> numbers are better, because a <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> HDL level can lower your risk for coronary artery disease and stroke. How <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> your HDL should be depends on your age and sex:</p>GroupHealthy HDL LevelAge 19 or youngerMore than 45mg/dlMen age 20 or olderMore than 40mg/dlWomen age 20 or olderMore than 50mg/dlHow can I raise my HDL level?<p>If your HDL level is too low, lifestyle changes may help. These changes may also help prevent other diseases, and make you feel better overall:</p><ul><li>Eat a healthy diet. To raise your HDL level, you need to eat good fats instead of bad fats. This means limiting saturated fats, which include full-fat milk and cheese, <span class=\"qt0\">high</span>-fat meats like sausage and bacon, and foods made with butter, lard, and shortening. You should also avoid trans fats, which may be in some margarines, fried foods, and processed foods like baked goods. Instead, eat unsaturated fats, which are found in avocado, vegetable oils like olive oil, and nuts. Limit carbohydrates, especially sugar. Also try to eat more foods naturally <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> in fiber, such as oatmeal and beans.</li><li>Stay at a healthy weight. You can boost your HDL level by losing weight, especially if you have lots of fat around your waist.</li><li>Exercise. Getting regular exercise can raise your HDL level, as well as lower your LDL. You should try to do 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise on most, if not all, days.</li><li>Avoid cigarettes.Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can lower your HDL level. If you are a smoker, ask your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit. You should also try to avoid secondhand smoke.</li><li>Limit alcohol. Moderate alcohol may lower your HDL level, although more studies are needed to confirm that. What we do know is that too much alcohol can make you gain weight, and that lowers your HDL level.</li></ul><p>Some cholesterol medicines, including certain statins, can raise your HDL level, in addition to lowering your LDL level. Health care providers don\\'t usually prescribe medicines only to raise HDL. But if you have a low HDL and <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> LDL level, you might need medicine.</p>What else can affect my HDL level?<p>Taking certain medicines can lower HDL levels in some people. They include:</p><ul><li>Beta blockers, a type of blood pressure medicine</li><li>Anabolic <span class=\"qt2\">steroids</span>, including testosterone, a male hormone</li><li>Progestins, which are female hormones that are in some birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy</li><li>Benzodiazepines, sedatives that are often used for anxiety and insomnia</li></ul><p>If you are taking one of these and you have a very low HDL level, ask your provider if you should continue to take them.</p><p>Diabetes can also lower your HDL level, so that gives you another reason to manage your diabetes.</p>\\n',\n",

There are different types of <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> blood pressure in pregnancy:</p><ul><li>Gestational <span class=\"qt0\">hypertension is high</span> blood pressure that you develop while you are pregnant. It starts after you are 20 weeks pregnant. You usually don\\'t have any other symptoms. In many cases, it does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. But it does raise your risk of <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> blood pressure in the future. It sometimes can be severe, which may lead to low birth weight or preterm birth. Some women with gestational <span class=\"qt0\">hypertension</span> do go on to develop preeclampsia.</li><li>Chronic <span class=\"qt0\">hypertension is high</span> blood pressure that started before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some women may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn\\'t know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic <span class=\"qt0\">hypertension</span> can also lead to preeclampsia.</li><li>Preeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. In rare cases, symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. Preeclampsia also includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidney. The signs may include protein in the urine and very <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> blood pressure.

It is rare, but very serious.</li></ul>What are the symptoms of preeclampsia?<p>Possible symptoms of preeclampsia include:</p><ul><li><span class=\"qt0\">High</span> blood pressure</li><li>Too much protein in your urine (called proteinuria)</li><li>Swelling in your face and hands. Your feet may also swell, but many women have swollen feet during pregnancy.

If you go on to develop HELLP syndrome, you may also have bleeding or bruising easily, extreme fatigue, and liver failure.</p>How is preeclampsia diagnosed?<p>Your health care provider will check your blood pressure and urine at each prenatal visit. If your blood pressure reading is <span class=\"qt0\">high</span> (140/90 or <span class=\"qt0\">higher</span>), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, your provider will likely want to run some tests. They may include blood tests other lab tests to look for extra protein in the urine as well as other symptoms.</p>What are the treatments for preeclampsia?<p>Delivering the baby can often cure preeclampsia. When making a decision about treatment, your provider take into account several factors. They include how severe it is, how many weeks pregnant you are, and what the potential risks to you and your baby are:</p><ul><li>If you are more than 37 weeks pregnant, your provider will likely want to deliver the baby.</li><li>If you are less than 37 weeks pregnant, your health care provider will closely monitor you and your baby. This includes blood and urine tests for you. Monitoring for the baby often involves ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, and checking on the baby\\'s growth. You may need to take medicines, to control your blood pressure and to prevent seizures. Some women also get <span class=\"qt2\">steroid</span> injections, to help the baby\\'s lungs mature faster. If the preeclampsia is severe, you provider may want you to deliver the baby early.</li></ul><p>The symptoms usually go away within 6 weeks of delivery. In rare cases, symptoms may not go away, or they may not start until after delivery (postpartum preeclampsia). This can be very serious, and it needs to be treated right away.</p>\\n',\n",

Motor neurons are a type of nerve cell in the spinal cord and <span class=\"qt1\">lower</span> part of the brain. They control movement in your arms, legs, face, chest, throat, and tongue.</p><p>As the motor neurons die off, your muscles start to weaken and atrophy (waste away). The muscle damage gets worse over time and can affect speaking, walking, swallowing, and breathing.</p>What are the types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and what are their symptoms?<p>There are different types of SMA. They are based on how serious the disease is and when the symptoms start:</p><ul><li>Type l is also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease or infantile-onset SMA. It is the most <span class=\"qt0\">severe</span> type. It is also the most common. Babies with this type usually show signs of the disease before 6 months of age. In more <span class=\"qt0\">severe</span> cases, the signs show up even before or just after birth (Types 0 or 1A). The babies may have trouble swallowing and breathing and may not move around a lot. They have chronic shortening of muscles or tendons (called contractures). They usually cannot sit up without help. Without treatment, many children with this type will die before 2 years of age.</li><li>Type ll is a moderate to <span class=\"qt0\">severe</span> type of SMA. It usually first noticed between 6 and 18 months of age. Most children with this type can sit without support but cannot stand or walk without help. They may also have trouble breathing. They can usually live into adolescence or young adulthood.</li><li>Type lll is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease. It is the mildest type that affects children. The signs of the disease usually show up after age 18 months. Children with this type can walk by themselves but may have trouble running, getting up from a chair, or climbing stairs. They may also have scoliosis (curvature of the spine), contractures, and respiratory infections. With treatment, most children with this type will have a normal lifespan.</li><li>Type IV is rare and often mild. It usually causes symptoms after 21 years of age. The symptoms include mild to moderate leg muscle <span class=\"qt4\">weakness</span>, tremors, and mild breathing problems. The symptoms slowly get worse over time. People with this type of SMA have a normal lifespan.</li></ul>What causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?<p>Most types of SMA are caused by a change in the SMN1 gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein that the motor neurons need to be healthy and to function. But when part of the SMN1 gene is missing or abnormal, there isn\\'t enough protein for the motor neurons. This causes the motor neurons to die off.</p><p>Most people have two copies of the SM1 gene - one from each parent. SMA normally only happens when both copies have the gene change. If only one copy has the change, there usually aren\\'t any symptoms. But that gene could be passed down from parent to child.</p><p>Some of the less common types of SMA may be caused by changes in other genes.</p>How is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) diagnosed?<p>Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose SMA:</p><ul><li>A physical exam</li><li>A medical history, including asking about family history</li><li>Genetic testing to check for the gene changes that cause SMA</li><li>Electromyography and nerve conduction studies and a muscle biopsy may be done, especially if no gene changes were found</li></ul><p>Parents who have a family history of SMA may want to do a prenatal test to check to see whether their baby has an SMN1 gene change. An amniocentesis or in some cases a chorionic villi sampling (CVS) is used to get the sample for testing.</p><p>In some states, genetic testing for SMA is part of newborn screening tests.</p>What are the treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?<p>There is no cure for SMA. Treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. They may include:</p><ul><li>Medicines to help the body make more of the proteins that the motor neurons need</li><li>Gene therapy for children under 2 years of age</li><li>Physical, occupational, and rehabilitation therapy to help to improve posture and the mobility of the joints. These therapies may also improve blood flow and slow muscle <span class=\"qt4\">weakness</span> and atrophy.

              " '<h1><span class=\"qt1\">Pain</span></h1> \\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/pain.html\\n<p><span class=\"qt1\">Pain</span> is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or <span class=\"qt1\">ache. Pain</span> may be sharp or dull. It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen, chest, pelvis, or you may feel <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> all over.</p><p><span class=\"qt1\">Pain</span> can be helpful in diagnosing a problem. If you never felt <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>, you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment.</p><p>There are two types of <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>: acute and <span class=\"qt0\">chronic</span>. Acute <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> usually comes on suddenly, because of a disease, injury, or inflammation. It can often be diagnosed and treated. It usually goes away, though sometimes it can turn into <span class=\"qt0\">chronic</span> <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>. <span class=\"qt0\">Chronic</span> <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> lasts for a long time, and can cause severe problems.</p><p><span class=\"qt1\">Pain</span> is not always curable, but there are many ways to treat it. Treatment depends on the cause and type of <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span>. There are drug treatments, including <span class=\"qt1\">pain</span> relievers. There are also non-drug treatments, such as acupuncture, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.</p><p>NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</p>\\n']"
